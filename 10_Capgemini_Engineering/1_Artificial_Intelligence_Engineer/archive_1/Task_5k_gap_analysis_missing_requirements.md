# Gap Analysis - Missing Requirements Assessment
## Artificial Intelligence Engineer at Capgemini Engineering (Food Delivery Client)

## Executive Summary

Aviral possesses a strong foundation in AI/ML, Python development, and production systems that aligns well with the core technical requirements. However, there are **4 critical framework gaps** and **3 domain-specific gaps** that currently prevent him from being the optimal candidate. The primary competitive disadvantage stems from lack of hands-on experience with specific agentic AI frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, Google's Agent Development Kit, Autogen) and absence of food delivery industry context.
