# Mogo - Full Stack AI Engineer (Remote)

## About the Job
**Join the Frontlines of an AI-Native Fintech**

At Mogo, we're reimagining the future of personal finance by embedding AI as the foundation — not as a layer. We're building intelligent, self-optimizing systems that aim to help millions of Canadians invest more intelligently and access credit more responsibly. Our platform is designed to break the cycle of short-term thinking in wealth and lending by combining proven value-investing principles with cutting-edge technology.

We're building an elite platform for the next generation — one that helps Canadians graduate from stock gambling, underperforming funds, and high-fee advisors. By embedding intelligence into every layer of the product, we're creating something that's transparent, scalable, and truly transformative.

If you're a full stack builder who wants to go beyond "using AI" and help create a fintech that is built on AI, we want to talk.

## The Role: Full Stack AI Engineer

We're looking for a product-minded engineer who can:

- Move fast like a startup dev
- Architect and ship production-grade systems
- Build LLM-native, intelligent workflows
- Help lead the evolution of Mogo into an AI-first platform

You'll drive development across backend systems and LLM agent orchestration, contributing to features that are autonomous, adaptive, and self-optimizing.

The base salary for this role is **$115,000 – $150,000 CAD**

## What You'll Build

### Production-Grade AI Systems
Deploy and maintain LLM-powered systems in production environments with clear SLAs, observability, and fallback strategies. Focus on scalability, latency, throughput, and reliability to ensure AI services deliver real business value

### AI-Native Workflows
Design and ship agent-based flows across onboarding, support, credit decisioning, and payments. You'll help build a self-serve credit experience that gets smarter with every user interaction, improving decisioning, repayments, and personalization through intelligence. Work cross-functionally with Product, Design, and Compliance to ensure these flows drive real outcomes and align with regulatory standards

### LLM Integrations
Work with **OpenAI**, **Claude**, **LangChain**, and other tools to build intelligent experiences. These include LLM-powered education tools and conversational interfaces that guide users through investing and credit decisions. Participate in architectural design discussions that center on securely and efficiently integrating LLM systems into production environments. Stay current with the latest AI advancements and evaluate emerging tools and frameworks that can advance our product

### End-to-End Features
Develop full stack features with real impact—from backend APIs and microservices in **Node.js/TypeScript** to intelligent frontends in **React** or **React Native**—supporting personalized, AI-powered finance journeys. Champion best practices in testing, deployment, and code quality through modern development workflows (**TDD**, **CI/CD**, AI-driven testing)

### Autonomous Infrastructure
Replace manual ops with AI-driven systems that don't just assist, but autonomously take action. Your work will enable a high-performance fintech operation that's lean, scalable, and largely self-managing

### Scalable Intelligence
Architect systems for continuous learning, observability, and performance. Define and monitor AI performance metrics to assess model behavior, user impact, and long-term value. Your solutions will support both a smarter lending platform and a next-generation investing experience grounded in value-investing principles and real-time data

### AI-Optimized Engineering Practices
Contribute to a culture of technical excellence by participating in code reviews, mentoring peers in AI-native engineering approaches, and continuously raising the bar for scalable, intelligent development.

## What You'll Need

- **4+ years** of experience as a full stack or backend engineer
- Strong skills in **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB/MySQL**
- Experience building and deploying LLM-based applications using **OpenAI**, **Claude**, **LangChain**, etc
- Comfort with AI workflows like **prompt chaining**, **embeddings**, **RAG**, or **vector search**
- Familiarity with **React/React Native** to build intelligent frontends
- Experience optimizing LLM inference or training pipelines for latency, throughput, or cost is a strong plus
- Familiarity with infrastructure-as-code and cloud-native tooling (e.g. **Docker**, **Terraform**, **AWS Lambda**, **CloudWatch**, **AWS CDK**)
- Proficient in batch processing tasks, system design, and test-driven development
- **Bonus**: Exposure to **Python** for AI scripting or LangChain workflows
- **Bonus**: Experience with **Ruby**, event-driven systems (**RabbitMQ/SQS**), or serverless AWS (**CDK**, **Lambda**)

## Who Thrives Here

You have a deep curiosity about AI's evolving landscape and enjoy staying on the frontier of tools and techniques

You mentor others and elevate your team through thoughtful feedback, shared learning, and technical clarity

You think AI is not a feature — it's the foundation

You believe fast iteration beats perfection

You're excited by 10x impact, not 10% improvements

You want to own outcomes, not just write code

You have a growth mindset and a builder's DNA

## AI Is the Driver - Let's Build the Future Together

This is not AI as an afterthought. It's the engine. We're not looking for someone to bolt AI onto existing systems — we're hiring engineers who want to rethink the entire system around intelligence.

If you want to be part of a fast-moving, high-performing team that's using AI to redefine what a fintech can be, apply now.
