## üéØ OVERALL ASSESSMENT: **STRONG PERFORMANCE**

**Likelihood of moving forward: HIGH (85%+)**

Sachin explicitly said:
- "I'm glad to hear you've got the experience on all those things"
- "Your experience will come handy for us"
- Stayed extra minutes beyond 30-min timeframe to answer questions

## ‚úÖ MAJOR STRENGTHS

### 1. **Technical Depth - Beauty Tech Data Lake Project**
- **What you did well:**
  - Led with scale (40TB/day, 40M+ customers, 15+ countries)
  - Detailed architecture (Step Functions, Lambda, DynamoDB, Athena, SageMaker)
  - Explained end-to-end ownership (requirements ‚Üí design ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí maintenance)
  - Mentioned specific technologies Scribd uses (SageMaker, AWS)
  
- **Impact:** Sachin commented "good to hear you have experience on SageMaker" - direct alignment

### 2. **EXCELLENT Spark/Scala Handling**
- **Critical moment:** When asked about Spark/Scala experience
- **Your response:** "We considered Spark, used Spark patterns with Step Functions"
- **Why it worked:**
  - Didn't say "I don't have experience" ‚ùå
  - Explained architectural reasoning (modularity, team experience, timeline)
  - Showed interest in learning ("natural next step", "graduation level")
- **Result:** Sachin clarified "not a deal breaker" and you confidently said you learn quickly

### 3. **STELLAR Cost Optimization Insight**
- **Game-changing moment:** Your 40% cost reduction explanation
- **What you said:**
  - Break down LLM tasks
  - Identify common patterns
  - Automate 40% with Python code
  - Only send dynamic parts to LLM
- **Why it mattered:** This DIRECTLY addresses Scribd's 2026 vision of a self-serving LLM platform
- **Sachin's reaction:** "I'm glad to hear you've got experience on all those things... will come handy"

### 4. **Project Scott (AI Documentation Agent)**
- Showed RAG pipeline experience (FAISS, Pinecone, ChromaDB)
- Explained multi-agent architecture (query splitting, dynamic agent creation)
- Demonstrated ability to handle ambiguity ("working backward from the problem")

### 5. **Excellent Questions**
- Asked about Scribd/Everand/Slideshare differences (shows research)
- Asked about biggest data engineering challenges (shows problem-solving mindset)
- Connected your experience to their problems (consolidated data lake analogy)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

### 1. **Verbosity / Rambling**
- **Example:** ML model explanation went back and forth multiple times
- **Impact:** Lost some clarity, though Sachin stayed engaged
- **Fix for next time:** Use signposting ("I'll cover 3 things: 1) X, 2) Y, 3) Z")

### 2. **Getting Flustered with Questions**
- **Example:** "Give me one second. Let me... is it okay if I pull that up?"
- **Impact:** Minor - showed you were organized, but broke flow
- **Fix:** Have 2-3 top questions memorized, others as backup

### 3. **Mini GPT Example**
- **What you said:** "Created my own mini GPT, trained it with four sentences"
- **Potential issue:** Might sound too basic/toy project
- **Better framing:** "Built a GPT implementation from scratch to understand transformer architecture fundamentals"

### 4. **$30K Savings Metric**
- **Issue:** This metric is from Prime Pantry (CI/CD optimization), NOT Beauty Tech data lake
- **Impact:** Could confuse if they dig deeper
- **Fix:** Either:
  - Remove from Beauty Tech opening statement
  - Clarify: "50% efficiency in data pipelines, plus $30K savings from CI/CD optimization across projects"

## üéì CRITICAL LEARNINGS ABOUT SCRIBD

### Team Structure & Focus
- **Team size:** 10 engineers (Toronto, Vancouver, US)
- **Two main domains:**
  1. **Content Moderation** (Content Trust): Policy enforcement, Google tools, fingerprints, LLMs
  2. **Content Enrichment** (Metadata extraction/generation): Title gen, TOC gen, document translation

### Current Challenges (2026 Roadmap)
1. **Scalability:**
   - 250M documents (10x increase from 25M recently)
   - Hitting OpenAI limits
   - 27 pages/doc √ó 250M = 6.5B images for multimodal inference
   
2. **Multi-LLM Complexity:**
   - Using multiple models (OpenAI, Gemini, open-source)
   - Different capabilities require different preprocessing (screenshots for multimodal)
   - Balancing cost vs. quality
   
3. **Self-Serving Platform Vision:**
   - **Goal:** Team members submit prompt ‚Üí select model ‚Üí run inference ‚Üí export data
   - **Why:** Can't keep building custom pipelines for every use case
   - **Your advantage:** Your 40% cost optimization approach is EXACTLY what they need

### Tech Stack Evolution
- **Legacy:** Spark/Scala on Airflow (30-day pipelines)
- **New:** AWS (Lambda, SQS) with custom framework
