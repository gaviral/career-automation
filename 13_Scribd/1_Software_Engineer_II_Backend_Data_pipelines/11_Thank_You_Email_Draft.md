## EMAIL DRAFT

**To:** Neha  
**Subject:** Thank you - Following up on today's interview with Sachin

---

Hi Neha,

Thank you so much for coordinating today's interview with Sachinâ€”I really appreciate you making it happen!

I had a great conversation with him about the team's work on metadata extraction and the exciting challenges ahead, especially around scaling LLM inference for 250M documents. The cost optimization and scalability problems he described really resonated with me, and I'm even more excited about the opportunity after learning about Scribd's 2026 vision for a self-serving LLM platform.

Could you please forward this message to Sachin?

**Message for Sachin:**

Hi Sachin,

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me todayâ€”and for staying a few extra minutes to answer my questions. I really enjoyed our conversation.

Hearing about the team's 2026 roadmap, especially the challenge of building a scalable, self-serving LLM platform, got me thinking even more about how my experience could contribute. The cost optimization approach I mentionedâ€”breaking down tasks to automate ~40% with Python before sending to LLMsâ€”is something I'd love to explore further in the context of processing 250M documents at scale.

I'm genuinely excited about the intersection of backend engineering, large-scale data pipelines, and LLM integration at Scribd, and the mission of democratizing knowledge through high-quality metadata resonates deeply with me.

Thank you again for the great conversation. Looking forward to next steps!

Best,  
Aviral
