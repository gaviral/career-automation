**Recruiter Screen: Aviral and Neha**

**Neha:** which is in Toronto and Vancouver. [ 0:01 ] Our working model is very flexible. We've also got a recognition and award this year for one of our innovative work culture where we have like we have a working model where we expect our folks to come like one day a month. So Vancouver, we do not have an office. We book a co-working space there. Folks who are local in the city, they are expected to go to the co-working spaces and which is roughly every third Wednesday of the month. So that like it's one common day where everybody's coming and the first sense like when it's it's kind of like a full attendance on that day. So that's what the model that we have. So I hope coming one day a month should be fine for you.

**Aviral:** Oh, definitely. [ 0:36 ] I I'm even like flexible for more, but like one day definitely obviously works.

**Neha:** Okay, cool. [ 0:43 ] And my next question, do you need any visa sponsorship to continue working in Canada with your future employer?

**Aviral:** No, I'm I'm a Canadian citizen, [ 0:50 ] so that shouldn't be a problem at all.

**Neha:** Cool. [ 0:54 ] Um last question, any specific base comp expectations, any number or let's say a range that you're looking at?

**Aviral:** Um well, I mean, I am looking for a package that would be reflective of uh like all the years of experience that I've had and um what I bring to the table. [ 1:11 ] But at the same time, I think it it's highly dependent on how like what I learn more about the role. Um so like I mean I did see I was going to ask you for a number but like I did I do see that in the job description there is a range mentioned, but I'm not sure if that's like region specific and um so I was more so wondering if you had a number.

**Neha:** So what we have specified is pretty much what we have there and that's completely also depends upon how the candidate performs in the technical rounds to qualify for that range because that's kind of like the broader range. [ 1:41 ] I know from a from a from a candidate standpoint, they would like to aim for a higher number and which is not bad obviously, but to just justify with the technical performance also. So I would say that's just the base compensation over and above that we have equity which comes in the form of stock options and then we have benefits and perks. We do not have anything like a performance bonus or a variable bonus. So it consists of base, benefits and equity in terms of the total comp structure.

**Aviral:** Perfect. [ 2:06 ] Yeah, I mean with those numbers in mind, I would be happy to proceed sorry, proceed forward.

**Neha:** Perfect, sounds good. [ 2:15 ] And let me give you a little bit overview on the role as well as what the next steps would entail. So your profile has already been shortlisted by the hiring manager. So this role, it's it's on the machine learning team and we are looking for someone who comes with a unique experience and a combination of backend plus data engineering tech stack. When I say backend, having programming experience in either Python or Scala, having like hands-on experience there. Second, data engineering tech stacks where someone who's worked on large scale distributed systems, uh where they have worked on data processing frameworks like Spark or data bricks, where they have worked on infrastructure as a code, they understand the cloud side of the infrastructure, uh preferably Terraform and this role reports directly to the senior engineering manager. This team is roughly I think close to like a eight member team. We are having three head counts that we are hiring for and um we are currently looking at I believe um the the team is split across Toronto mostly, then we have a few team members in Vancouver and then there are two people spread across US. So we are open to hire across US and Canada primarily. Um and the process is very straightforward. It starts with initial discussion with the hiring manager, 30 minutes of a chat. Post that, we have a technical loop consisting of coding and a system design. And very last then we have a behavioral chat with the director. So like four rounds, uh three stages and that's pretty much before we make a final call on the offer and yeah, I mean, I think in terms of the pipeline, we're moving a little bit faster. We have a few candidates at mid stages already. So um yeah, I mean I would say like sooner the better. And um if you're interested and ready to proceed, I can let you know like what the what the immediate next step would be and you can discuss the focus areas and who you'll be meeting and stuff like that.

**Aviral:** 100%. [ 3:57 ] I would like that.

**Neha:** Okay. So, uh you'd be you'd be meeting with Sachin. He's a senior engineering manager on the team and a little bit about him, he's been working with script, I think four plus, four plus years now. He started as an EM, he's currently a senior EM and this discussion with him would be mostly kind of like a discussion-based interview to understand more about your technical experience. So you might be interested to get an understanding from you on any interesting technical project that you can give a walk through on where you've worked on back end plus data engineering tech stack. So you can focus on large scale distributed systems and where you can talk about infrastructure as a code. So what was the project? What were the challenges? What kind of trade-offs or architectural choices you've made in that project? And lastly, what was the end result? So yeah, I mean, I think a full project walk through. Second, what is it that you are looking for, like what kind of team culture or what kind of role you would like to strive for? And lastly, whatever interesting questions you may have for Sachin. If this one goes well, we will proceed to the next steps. and which is going to be the technical loop. Um yeah, I think so you would like to evaluate a candidate on their obviously like the technical knowhow that they would discuss during the project discussion. Second, obviously the storytelling skills, like I know at times in a 30 minutes of an interview, a person could get nervous, they want to share a lot of details. I always suggest candidates that try to come up with impactful projects because you are having those first 15, 20 minutes to make an impact in an interview. Um so yeah, I mean like do brainstorming, like just just tie around or structure your project in a way where you're telling a compelling story and um yeah, and lastly, how much interest you are showing for script, what kind of questions you're asking, what kind of research have you done and things like that.

**Aviral:** Okay. [ 5:44 ] No, that makes sense. This is very useful info.

**Neha:** Forward an organic one. [ 5:47 ] but yeah, I mean, those would be some of the focus areas for this chat.

**Aviral:** Right. [ 5:51 ] Okay. No, that that is actually very useful information. I really like how structured and everything you um yeah, yeah, it yeah, so that that would be very helpful, I believe in the the interview itself. Um because there are a lot of things that a person would like to tell, but yeah, yeah.

**Neha:** I know and in an interview environment, the jitters could come, so we understand that. [ 6:10 ] Uh but yeah, I mean Sachin is pretty candid and he would love to share those details. Um I'm not sure like how much prep time you would need available, but any um any any date time that you'd be ready for this discussion, like which you might want to give me now or do you want to circle back over the?

**Aviral:** Um I could circle back to you because I think it's not it's less about like the time. [ 6:33 ] Uh right now I do have like back-to-back interviews uh for like this this week and the early next week. So uh but uh like in terms of like timeline, what were you thinking? Because I can try to fit something in early next week.

**Neha:** Okay, let me see. [ 6:49 ] So I know Sachin is uh he's available until tomorrow. So he's in Toronto, first of all. He's in Eastern time zone. He's available until tomorrow and then he's out Friday and Monday, we have an holiday. Um so we can we can start like if not tomorrow, if tomorrow's too early for you, we can do something on a Tuesday if that works for you.

**Aviral:** Oh, Tuesday. [ 7:11 ] Um let me just quickly look at my calendar if you don't mind.

**Neha:** Yeah, yeah. [ 7:15 ]

**Aviral:** Uh Tuesday is um yeah, it would work. [ 7:21 ]

**Neha:** Would work? [ 7:23 ] Okay. Yeah, I mean, we could do whatever times work for you. He has a few slots available like um 2:30 Eastern, 2:30 to 4. That works. Yeah.

**Aviral:** 2:30 to 4:30 [ 7:37 ] Eastern.

**Neha:** so which means 11:30 to 1:30 your time. [ 7:40 ]

**Aviral:** Right. [ 7:41 ] Yeah, that that works.

**Neha:** Would that work? [ 7:43 ] So do you do you like shall we just book it for 2:30?

**Aviral:** I I I would like that. [ 7:48 ] Um Tuesday is actually one of the days uh it's it's wide open. Um yeah, it's the days surrounding that uh coincidentally when when I have other interviews.

**Neha:** Got it. [ 7:58 ] Okay. So So I'll just take a note. [ 8:02 ] Next week Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. Pacific. My colleague Jamy will send you the meeting invite for your chat with Sachin. This is going to be 30 minutes of a Google Meet video link. And um yeah, if this one goes well, we would be proceeding to the next steps then.

**Aviral:** I'll be looking forward to that. [ 8:20 ]

**Neha:** Absolutely. [ 8:21 ] Very excited. Um and feel free to get back to me if you would have any other questions. But I think that's pretty much from my end.

**Aviral:** Sure thing. [ 8:30 ] Um well, I did have a quick question about well, there was one thing about like the next steps, but also, um I wanted to learn more about um like you mentioned something about like there there isn't any performance related um like evaluations. Like that I I maybe I misheard that.

**Neha:** Like I meant technical performance. [ 8:48 ] Like when we have a when we have a comp range which is a little bit broader, we would like to evaluate a candidate on how they have performed in the technical interviews to decide the level whether someone would be on the lower end of that comp band that we mentioned or probably mid or high. So that's what I mean.

**Aviral:** Oh, okay. [ 9:06 ] Okay. Yeah, for some reason, I just like in my head, I collected connected it to um like just no performance evaluations, uh which was like very very unheard of. That's why I just wanted to clarify and not leave anything like that.

**Neha:** No, I I technical performance in the interview, like how have they performed in the interview environment. [ 9:21 ]

**Aviral:** Perfect. [ 9:24 ] Um and uh I wanted to also know a little bit more about the specific role. Um like so for for this role, um um like I know you mentioned like uh the the tech stack and things that are required, but I'm wondering if there's um if you could, I know there might be confidentiality stuff here, but uh is there like could you tell me a little bit more about the project uh that um the manager is looking to hire for?

**Neha:** Yeah, so I can I can shed some light. [ 9:48 ] I'm sure Sachin can walk you through in more technicalities, but this team is working, let's say we we currently have close to 2 million paid subscribers. We get around like 200 million unique visitors every month on our on our platform, website and app. Uh this team is the one which manages the entire um collection of that data. Like they they they convert the raw data into more data ingestion pipeline which is further then used by data scientists and data analyst. Um this team is slightly more impactful team because they are working across all three product ranges that script is having, which is um the documentation, slide share which we acquired from LinkedIn in 2020 and then third one is Everand, which is our audio content and e- content in form of audio books and podcast, etc. So this team is the one which is working across all three product range. We have very recently acquired Fable, which is I'm not sure if you heard about Fable. It's into community-based learning and that's also becoming part of our product domain like I think most likely by next year. Um so I mean so just think about it when one team is working across the large chunk of data and how they would have to make an impact within um script's team versus engineering and non-engineering where like those data can be further used by other engineering or like product teams or kind of like for them to do further analysis on. So this is what like very broadly they are responsible to do. Um broadly this org is driving our AI business as well in terms of like how script is embracing AI. So um I think they like they they are the front runners or the drivers behind the AI build. So I'm sure like they can talk more about it from that standpoint, but that's what I know about this particular team.

**Aviral:** Right. [ 11:36 ] Yeah, it could be a little bit presumptuous from my end, but it's almost sounds like a data lake that everyone can consume. Like you're the up this team would be the the project for this team would be the upstream for a lot of different um yeah, uh lines.

**Neha:** across engineering. [ 11:50 ]

**Aviral:** Yeah, cross engineering. [ 11:51 ] And this actually sounds like something that I have built because the very the in the entire pipeline that I was telling you about that like it was the first project that I did was the data ingestion for like all the other teams because I was one of the first engineers in the beauty tech that the revamped beauty tech that we were building and yeah, it essentially we built started off with this VTO project, the virtual try on project and it kind of led into creating a big beauty tech data lake which um was now consumed actually by um all the recommendation team, the the interactive experience and the customer experience team and yeah, so it was something that not just technical people but also even product managers, they would do like natural languages uh scripting just like simple language natural language get me this product and um yeah, there are more projects that I can always just go on about but it it sounds like something right up my alley.

**Neha:** Nice. [ 12:47 ] That's that's great to know and I'm sure like if you are more curious about the technicalities which Sachin or if you progress further in the panel, they can also talk to you more about that those things.

**Aviral:** Definitely. [ 12:58 ] I look forward to it.

**Neha:** Absolutely. [ 13:00 ] Um cool. All right. I think that's pretty much then and I'll circle back with you once we get the feedback.

**Aviral:** Sure thing. [ 13:07 ] Thank you, Neha.

**Neha:** Take care. [ 13:08 ] Thank you.

**Aviral:** Take care. [ 13:09 ] Bye.

**Neha:** Bye. [ 13:10 ]
