---

## Interview Process Description

The interview consisted of 3 rounds:

1. **Initial Recruiter Screen (20 min)** - Recruiter conducted high-level background review, asked about experience w/ LLMs/AI agents, discussed salary expectations ($120K-$160K range), & posed technical question about LLM context window degradation

2. **Behavioral/Background Deep Dive (45-60 min)** - Same recruiter conducted extensive behavioral interview w/ situational questions, explored Amazon projects in detail, assessed comfort w/ startup ambiguity

3. **Final Decision** - Informed via follow-up that they were moving forward w/ other candidates despite being told position would progress to technical & executive rounds if behavioral went well

---

## Interview Difficulty

**Selected:** ⭐⭐ Easy

The interviews themselves were straightforward. Questions focused on past projects (especially Project Scott - my AI documentation agent at Amazon), comfort w/ startup environment, & standard behavioral scenarios. Technical question asked during recruiter screen was surface-level (context window degradation percentage).

**Rationale:** Not challenging technically; primarily conversational & behavioral in nature.

---

## What Was One Thing They Asked You?

**Question:** "At what percentage of usage of the LLM context window are we starting to see a degradation in the deterministic capacity of the LLM to route to the correct tool call (function call)?"

**My Answer:** Gave range of 70-80% as best guess, then explained I'd developed prompt engineering techniques & context refresh strategies that overcame these limits entirely - citing example of achieving 8M tokens in conversation when model only supported 200K through caching & context management.

**Context:** This was asked during first recruiter screen by non-technical recruiter who acknowledged she couldn't elaborate on it. Question seemed designed as gate-keeping assessment rather than genuine technical exploration.

## Overall Experience & Why Negative

**What Went Wrong:**

The interview process was fundamentally **dishonest & disrespectful of my time**. 

After first recruiter screen, I was told next steps would be: (1) deeper behavioral interview w/ same recruiter, (2) technical interview, (3) executive interview - total of 3 more rounds.

After completing 2nd round (behavioral deep dive) which lasted full hour & went very well, I was led to believe I'd progress to technical round. Instead, recruiter followed up saying they were moving forward w/ "other candidates already in final stages."

**Key Issues:**

1. **Misleading Process:** Why conduct hour-long behavioral deep dive if candidates in final stages already? Should have been communicated upfront that this was backup pipeline, not active hiring

2. **Time Disrespect:** Invested ~2 hours total (20 min + 60 min + prep time for both rounds) only to learn position was essentially filled. Recruiter even mentioned during 2nd interview they had candidates in final stages but continued w/ full interview anyway

3. **Poor Communication:** Recruiter mentioned multiple times "I'd love to move you forward to next round" & "it depends on how you do in technical interview" - creating false expectation of progression when reality was they were just building backup candidate pool

4. **Bait & Switch on Timeline:** During 2nd interview, recruiter said "we have a few candidates in final stages" & "we just have one opening by end of year" but continued asking about MY timeline/other offers as if this was competitive decision. This was manipulative - trying to gauge my urgency while knowing they likely weren't hiring me

**What This Reveals About Company:**

- **Lack of respect for candidate time** - particularly problematic for startup claiming to value efficiency & pragmatism
- **Poor internal coordination** - recruiter shouldn't be conducting deep behavioral interviews for backup pipeline without being transparent about it
- **Questionable startup culture** - if this is how they operate in hiring (waste candidate time, lack transparency), red flag for how they'd operate as employer

**The Irony:**

Job description emphasized: "move quickly and pragmatically in early-stage environment" & "thrive in ambiguity" - yet company demonstrated opposite: slow, unclear process that wasted everyone's time through lack of transparency.

## Advice to Future Candidates

1. **Ask directly about pipeline status** - "Are there other candidates in final stages?" "Is this active hiring or backup pipeline?"

2. **Request transparent timeline** - Don't accept vague "we'll get back to you" - ask specific decision dates

3. **Be wary of recruiter-heavy process** - 2 rounds w/ same recruiter (not hiring manager or technical team) before any technical assessment is unusual & suggests disorganized process

4. **Watch for these red flags:**
   - "We have other candidates in final stages but let's continue w/ full interview anyway"
   - "We'll get back to you ASAP but may not be until next week" (non-committal language)
   - Recruiter asking about YOUR timeline/offers when they haven't committed to next steps

5. **Consider this context:** Vooban Labs is subsidiary of larger consultancy (Vooban). Had only 2 engineers when I interviewed (1 just started). Very early stage. Might not have hiring process figured out yet - but that's not your problem as candidate.

## Final Thoughts

**Would I recommend interviewing here?** 

Only if you:
- Have explicit confirmation you're being considered for ACTIVE opening (not backup pipeline)
- Get clear timeline commitments upfront
- Speak w/ hiring manager (CEO in this case) or technical team early in process (not just recruiter for 2 rounds)

**Would I accept offer if extended?**

After this experience - unlikely. Process reveals potential cultural issues around transparency, respect for time, & communication that would likely surface as employee too.

**Rating:** ⭐⭐ (2/5)

The interviews themselves were fine, even enjoyable in terms of questions asked. But overall experience was negative due to lack of transparency & respect for candidate time. Startup environment requires trust - this process eroded it before employment even began.
