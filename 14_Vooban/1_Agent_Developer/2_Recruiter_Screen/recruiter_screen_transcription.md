## Interview Transcription

.
Hi, Everell.
Hey. How are you? Oh. Oh, you're on mute.
Hey. How are you doing? Samar, am I saying it right?
Said it perfectly, and I hope I pronounced yours correctly. Is it
viral? Viral? The first yeah. The the latter one was perfect.
And, like, I give a hard time to everyone, so you can call me Avi with with this.
Well, like, hard time with my name. Not Yeah. No. No. Overall, I think
hopefully, I said it right. Oh, no. Everell. Everell. Yes.
That that was actually a pretty good job. Yeah.
No. Awesome. Thank you so much. How's your day been going so
far? Pretty good, actually. Yeah. It's a nice good weather here in Vancouver.
Nice. I was gonna ask and confirm where you're based. You're in Vancouver.
I am.
Okay. No. I've only been to Vancouver once just for a very brief
trip, like a two day trip, but very beautiful, great weather, great food. So excited to
go back for sure. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Like, it's it's a beauty like, it's
part of the beautiful British Columbia. So It is. Yeah.
No. That's awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with
me today. Just before getting started, we do have an AI notetaker that will record the
call and take notes. Are you comfortable with me adding it? I am.
Perfect. You should be able to see it there.
And I'm just gonna search my screen here.
Great. Well, overall, again, thank you so much for
taking the time to chat with me. Obviously, I think you have a really great profile. And what do want
to take this opportunity just to ask a few questions, learn a little bit more about your background skill set,
well as tell you a little bit more about us and what we're looking for. The reason this
is scheduled for about fifteen to twenty minutes is because if goes well, the next step
or if we you know, there's alignment on both of our ends Mhmm. The next
step will be with me again, and that's when we're really gonna dig in deeper in your background. Okay?
Sounds good.
Cool. I'd love to turn it over to you if you can give me a quick background about
yourself. Absolutely. Well, I'm Avril Kirk. And, yeah,
like, I've been a software engineer for almost, like, like,
five to seven years. Like, I I actually, like, I would say exactly
like, seven years. And, yeah, like, I've had
like, a good amount of experience in in a lot of areas, I would say.
Like, I've like, as
like like, I would say, like, at Amazon specifically for the more more
five years, I've built AI powered cloud applications.
I've, split specialized in building, like, AI agents.
And full stack solutions. Right?
Like, like, I've had the chance
to deal with, mostly in AWS because it's Amazon.
And I've used Python, LangChain,
modern, LLM frameworks.
OpenAI agent SDK,
which was, like, very like, somewhat similar to
auto gen and Creo AI. And I've
had a chance to experiment with Creo AI and Autogen as well.
Of course, LangChain and all these different things come up.
Like, they're they're they're, like, bread and butter there.
One thing I'd like to highlight is I built this project Scott an AI agent powered with, like, in
documentation that answered, like, all team questions instantly.
Like, it basically, if let's say,
at Amazon, I was in the beauty tech organization,
Let's say you wanted to join the team. You you are the new hire there.
Then, you would ask a question from the project
Scott from Scott that I've built and integrated into Slack itself. And
it would look up the documentation, do rag
retrieval augmented generation, and it would
get the right documentation for you. Now here's the best part.
If it didn't find the documentation or there was partial match,
it would contact the subject matter expert for the topics
it detected. It would
instead of bothering them, bugging them about, hey. Go and fill the documentation, it would ask
specific minute, very concrete questions, get those answers,
fill up the documentation, respond back to you with all the questions that you have.
Right? And, like, it connected itself to their internal ticketing system then
it basically, like, it and it was all, like, built on agents.
Like, oh, we used OpenAI. It like, the open source
project that OpenAI has, the OpenAI agents Python.
And then, like, new tickets are coming in.
Scott goes and, like, answers all those questions.
As much as possible. And whatever new comments that developers are putting in there,
it will learn from that. It would add itself pretty much to everything, I would say.
So, yeah, like, had massive impacts there. We
like, ticket resolution times by
82%. I remember doing some calculations there and getting getting
the impact metrics. We'd saved, like,
more than two hundred and forty dev hours, like, per
per per month. This was like, it was one of the biggest
that we had seen because we
and we finished. Like, we actually reached 100% documentation completion.
Because we like, for our particular organization,
because now it was everyone
is now focused on more of their coding. So it connected itself to
coding age there were coding agents in there too. Someone would create a pull request
and yeah. Like like, Scott coding agent would look at that, read that, say, hey. Like, is this good documentation?
Let me add it to our like, the whole documentation map.
Mhmm. Documentation repository.
Anyways, long story long.
I that was one of the, like, one of the best
projects that I like, best projects are, like, that would I would say,
highlight here because there is a good overlap between
what you guys are looking for and, like, in terms of, like,
all the agentic work that I've done, like, it it was one of the biggest
that we worked on that I worked on and I led.
Then there have been, like, other projects
like, where I've led eight engineers building serverless data pipelines.
Processing forty forty terabyte more
more than 40 terabytes of data coming in every day.
And serving, like, more than 40,000,000 customers monthly.
Mhmm. And, yeah, I've dabbled in in recent, like, personal projects
as well to experiment with all these new technologies, like,
Creo AI, Google agent kit, even Autogen.
And just to just to play around and see how different they are
from all the things that I've worked on, there there were some good things, there were some bad
things about them. But, yeah, overall, like,
I'm excited about Vuban. I'm not sure if I'm saying that correctly, though.
VuBan. Yes. VuBan. Okay. Yeah. VuBan because it's it seems like it's a foundational role.
Where, I can work directly with the CEO to define like, at least that's what I saw in the job description.
To define, like, the age the agent architecture from the ground up.
Right? Like like, we I've
I actually was the first agent, developer, at
my company as well, like, bringing in this project.
Well, seeing one of the pain points about documentation, it was
one of the biggest issues there. So I immediately attacked that with
using the latest and the greatest technology while being
very cautious about all the issues that come with it
and there were so many great learnings. We experimented fast
and rapidly developed, like,
solutions to all the issues that we had. So Yeah. Yeah. I I
a little something about me. That's awesome.
No. Thank you so much, overall. Honestly, it seems pretty impressive, and
it's awesome to hear that you led that project, Scott, as well. I'm curious
I guess, what was your involvement from like, were you the one to kind of come up with the idea
the very beginning? Or, like, can you talk walk me through what that process was like?
Oh, 100%. It was complete like, it was one one thing I had
that had been a pet peeve for me in multiple different
places that I've worked with was the lack of documentation.
And understandably so. Like, it is a very common problem that a lot of places had.
And for me, because of that, I was always thinking,
like, how can we improve that? Let's let's like, I understand a lot of developers don't want to
focus on that. I don't understand it, but
No. It's more so, like, a lot of people do miss.
Out on what the the good ways to do documentation.
And so I worked backward from there. And, like, it was one of the,
like, at Amazon, we are given a lot of opportunities to improve our operational readiness
and our processes. And I saw the biggest gap right there, and I I just like
attacked that head on. For me,
like, the solution now with, like, all the
the AI revolution that's happening with LLMs and the research paper of
attention is all you need.
That Yeah. It it basically, like, seeing
what what that research paper started and chat GPT and everything.
I saw right there, documentation is all about language. Natural language processing, NLP's,
and, like, where where you all these kits that are coming in every day.
So it was completely my idea.
I led that project. I had a
three developers, like, under me, one machine learning engineer, but I actually had to work
with the entire organization with a variety of people, like data scientists,
business intelligence engineers because everyone wanted documentation. Everyone
had questions about it. And when it there was a lot of red teaming done as well, but
I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself walking through
That was the the, like, idea that I had. And in our it's
off as a very small, like, person
project, like, that I was experimenting with at work.
But then I proposed that to my manager, and it, like, just
got a one pager going. It got a, like, great traction there.
It just, like, something that everyone was like, yes. A lot of people
are working on something like this, but this is a good concrete
implementation that I had, like, a prototype that I had ready for them.
So that like, I experimented with, like, some dummy documents
at first, had vector databases created for that topic
search that I was telling you about where
and, actually, I forgot to mention
right before this project idea, I actually was just like, I took
the ownership of documentation cleanup
because that had been brought up so many times that are like, in our
stand ups and our organization wide meetings that
I took a organization wide beauty tech organization wide initiative
where every topic was assigned we had
like, a reference table of these are the topics and
these are the subject matter experts for those topics.
So every time a newcomer came in, they would go reference that table, and they would actually go and talk
those people, ask questions, and, of course, documentation and everything was mapped
nicely. So I gave ownership to a lot of
thing topics that what didn't have any owners,
like, conducted that workshop and and people volunteered for that.
And that right there became the perfect, like, starting point for
project Scott because Scott now used that
And instead of newcomers bothering them again, bothering more so like,
things were questions were now a lot more focused. Right?
With the help of AI. So that right there served as a starting point for that idea
and then that led to, okay, we have vector database.
Where we are now automatically creating new documents, and it automatically
goes into the vector database. People ask question. It's
say does the classification.
Some classification models of what topics are
there and how like, so it we we worked with that. But
replaced that with just, like, local Olama models.
And and yeah. Like, I think it organically right
that when we were getting the vector databases to work, topics were corrected.
Then we more went more into the nitty gritty use of creating specific
agents, using the OpenAI agent, framework.
To essentially like, everyone
like, has question. Like, there were so many experiments
done in in all of this where what is the best path.
How much costs are happening? So we create I like, I created multiple
system designs for this and had it
entire team wide review where senior engineers, AI engineers, even outside the
team, they came in to do their review of this. I
recommended a specific design proposal, and that got selected along with
like, some modifications that were done to it. And, yeah, we
essentially were able to deliver this whole thing and and have a
major impact on the organization.
Amazing. No. Thank you so much for clarifying that. That's definitely a huge
plus. Obviously, with this I'll give you a quick little background about us.
Before applying, have you ever heard of LoopNet? I had not.
Okay. So just to give you a quick little background. So Vuven, we're actually a digital transformation
And what we do is we're essentially a one stop shop for everything related
to digital solutions, whether it be software development, Internet of Things, cloud, you name it.
Mhmm. But our bread and butter and almost all of our projects have an AI component to it.
That's where essentially, honestly, probably 99% of our projects are
AI related. Mhmm. And we're industry agnostic. We work with a lot of different clients and all
industries, but the majority I will say are in manufacturing, logistics,
aerospace, and construction. Mhmm. Right. So that's Buben. Yeah. Was a services company. This
specific role, however, is actually under VuBen Labs, which is a
subsidiary of Vuvan. So it is a company, and it's a product company.
But it does fall under the Vuven umbrella. But it's a separate team, separate
CEO. Mhmm. And, obviously, as I mentioned, it's a product
company. So the goal for this is we're really building AI agents from scratch. First,
for VuBan is your internal client, if you will. So
really getting to know what all the different teams' pain points or challenges are
what type of AI agents could really help, improve the workflow for those team members.
And then also selling those AI agents or creating new AI agents for our
clients' needs as well. Uh-huh. And selling them externally to external
clients. But that's essentially what the role is going to be.
I said, VuBan essentially is going to be, I guess, your
first client. Really going to be developing AI agents for
all different clients, and which is why it is somewhat of a complex
role, and we're really looking for people with strong expertise in agent development that
can really hit the ground running. Today, we're we
have two engineers. Mhmm. One that just started with us last week.
And then we have the CEO and the COO.
So you still would be
very closely working with the CEO and the COO and
we still have not even finalized what the tech stack is going to look like.
Python, for sure. But when it comes to LLM tool chains, at least
based on my last conversation with the team a few weeks ago, it
finalized yet. Mhmm. But all of that stuff is still under process. We're
still in the process of putting structure, putting documentation
processes in place, which is why, you know, we want someone who is also comfortable
being in that type of environment. Which brings me to my next
question. Obviously, you know, you've been with Amazon for many, many years. Mhmm. How do
do you feel about being in this type of somewhat ambiguous environment where
things really have to be built from scratch and there might be little documentation,
processes in place. Absolutely. I would say I don't
think they would it would feel like a lot of change from my previous role itself.
Because that was one of the things that we always worked on as even if things were given concrete
to you, you time box things and work backward from what exactly
are are we solving. Why are we solving it the way
right now you're pro like, so you come to me as a product manager and
you tell me that that we want it done this way.
There would be like, first question would be, let's focus on, like, the issues
exactly are we trying to solve? Who are our customers?
Let's understand them, and work backward from that.
Essentially. Picking up new languages, new frameworks,
that is not something like that is like, that those things are kind of
like, it's good to have. You have, like, these
like, I've I've dabbled with, like, six or seven different languages.
At Amazon. And three actually, four of them I had never, like, dealt with before.
And, like, it was never really an issue because we have, like, so many tools that
can help us out. It's really working backward from
what are we trying to solve. Does this actually
solve the problem, whatever you're proposing? And even if, let's say, you're not proposing anything, but
there's, like we have to build something from ground up. It's it's something that I I feel like I've
I've always done. This was the case
was one one of the the the 40 terabyte pipeline project that I was telling you about.
We, like, I basically actually, no. That one there was a framework before, but it was a third framework, but we'd like, it wasn't a solution. We were just paying someone
to do a certain thing for us. The certain thing being
visual properties from lipstick
product images. Right? So the product that
I worked on was essentially you could go on a Amazon app,
and you can try on different lipsticks, foundations,
and and different made makeup products. For that to happen, you need a three d model
the lips along with the lipstick color, the glitter,
shimmer, and different kinds of property visual properties about it.
Now the problem we had was
there was no standard way of naming a color.
One of the lipsticks had unicorn red. So I'm
I'm like, what what exact what RGB colors do do we give that?
Right? And then the particles were large, medium, small,
Like, it didn't really help. So we like, the this problem was presented
me as one of the first projects at the beauty tech at in the beauty tech team.
And there, I I sat down and worked with
the like, worked with like, looked at actually customer experiences
our existing solution that we had where a lot of things were hidden to
So we wanted to build that ground up, and I sat down with product managers,
like, heard real customer experiences, sat down in those sessions,
was able to come up with
okay, these are the exact list of doing requirement engineering,
doing the design for it, implementing it, and then even maintaining it.
Another thing at Amazon was I might be digressing a tiny bit here.
But it's like we take ownership. All developers take ownership
for everything that they're building. We don't hand it off to the the team later on.
I feel like in software development life cycle,
taking it all the way from even requirements engineering to all the way to maintaining it
years after we've already built it, that is something that we did.
So being in an environment where
you're saying, like, we have to build things from ground up. We have to do all the design.
I feel like it it it would seem like home to me.
Yeah. Amazing. Perfect. No. As long as that's something that you're
with, so thank you so much for that. And
also if you don't mind me asking, know, again, we have about five minutes I do have another call. But I just want to confirm,
as I mentioned, you've been there for many years. Do mind me asking what was the reason for leaving Amazon?
I I don't mind at all. It was actually like, my team and I
like, were laid off in March 2025.
We like, it was a organization reorg
was happening, and my manager me, my manager, my manager's manager we were all impacted by that. And it was just
something that they had decided, and that's why I
took that time to, yeah, you know, like, take that opportunity
spend quality time with family. And even though I've been doing that AI agent work,
I wanted to also learn, like, things from ground up.
So I even enrolled in, like, a year long machine learning course
we, like literally, we started off from, like, the actual basic math We did the calculus, gradient descent, and 100 other things, and it was, like,
a a lot of fun. So it felt like a good break
after five years of Amazon, like, lots of intense work.
So, yeah, good, refreshed, energized, and ready to go.
While keeping up with all the latest and greatest in the tech.
So that's kind of how things went after the layoff.
Love to hear it. Okay. No. I I obviously, I know it's unfortunate with the
but I'm glad at least you got that time to unwind. And I do think, like, the market is picking up
a lot, especially for, you know, profiles like yourself. There's a huge demand for that. So
I appreciate that transparency. But
I also am curious regarding usually,
you know what? No. I will ask it. I was just gonna try to be mindful of the time here. But
we have a technical question that we usually like to ask in
this round. Mhmm. Obviously, keep in mind, I'm not a technical person, so I can't really
elaborate on it or anything. Just give me your best guess Mhmm. Or, like,
your best answer is for this. And, again, I'm looking for
a percentage, but, please feel free to have me repeat the
question as many times as you'd like. But, my question here is, at what
percentage of usage of the LLM context window are we starting to
see a degradation in the deterministic capacity of the LLM?
To route to the correct tool call, aka the function call.
Could you repeat that? Yeah. What percent of usage
the LLM context window Mhmm. Are we starting to
see a degradation or a decline in the deterministic capacity
of the LLM to route to the correct tool call, aka the function call.
I do not know the theoretical answer to this.
My get best guess about this would be around
70 to 80%, but it's actually something I
whenever we like, I when I know we're short on time. I'll
be very quick on this. We face this exact issue and
I actually managed to develop, like, prompt engineering techniques
where we defied these limits
Like, we absolutely obliterated those limits.
Because the way we kept keeping context refreshing
I've actually developed strategies where
like, which I use every day these days.
Where I've had one hour long conversations
where the context window actually went all the way up to
8,000,000 tokens in at in a
a LLM model that supported only 200,000 tokens. So, like, the way we refreshed and did did
caching of all the tokens and the context,
that right there was something. Like, instead of just
like, just using AI wrap API
wrappers around OpenAI and cloud models,
We did a lot of engineering on top of that. And by we, I mean, this
was completely led by me. Like,
this wasn't assigned to any other engineer either. There were
certain smaller things, vector database that were assigned, in the project.
But this was something that I personally did it myself. So Okay. Yeah.
No. Thank you for that. And, yeah, again, like, there's
it's just more so that, you know, the team will be able to assist better, but, I do appreciate you giving me the range.
Just a few last things that I want to confirm with you is regarding your
availability. If you were to move forward, when would you be able to start?
I would be happy to start as soon as possible.
Since now I'm actively looking for the job, and I'm not working anywhere.
Okay. So thank you for that. And when it
comes to your, I guess, location, I know you mentioned you are in Vancouver.
And just to confirm, you're not open to relocation?
I would be given the right package, but preference right
now would be remote. It it really depends on
not not just the package, but also, like, learning more about
the the team and, like, the overall
environment. Yeah.
Nope. Totally understandable. And it's not a mandate for it with
whatsoever. I say this because pretty much all of our team members
right now or most of our team members are in Quebec, either Montreal or Quebec City. Mhmm. With the COO, however, is in LA.
So at least, you know, time zone there. So,
if you were in Quebec then or Quebec City specifically, it would be, like,
one day in office per week. But Mhmm. Anywhere else in the world,
essentially, fully remote. So in this case, of course, it would be remote.
But when it comes to your also your work authorization in Canada,
I'm a citizen. A Canadian citizen. Yeah.
Perfect. And then finally, salary expectations. What would you be looking for?
This is something that I think like, I'm looking for a package that
reflects my five years more than five years of experience at
Amazon. And even before that, like, there have been, like, more experiences.
And I think I'd be able to give a number, like, only after, like,
having, like, learned more about the position itself. I was wondering if you guys had
like, a range. I know I saw something on the job description itself.
But I wanted to like, wondering if you had more details about that.
Yeah. Absolutely. I'll be honest that when we initially did this, our
range or our maximum was about 120,000 budget.
And, obviously, after further conversation, we realized it's not exactly aligned.
With the type of profiles we want. Mhmm. So
we are kinda keeping it open ended. It's really dependent
on the candidate, the type of experience they bring, and more specifically, how they do it in the technical
round. I will say just to be completely transparent, right now the
highest that we've hired someone out is a 160,000. Mhmm. I truly would love
to keep it at that range. Mhmm. But, yeah, that that's the
essentially where we're at at the moment. So curious with that in mind.
Does it sound like it would be aligned with what you're looking for, or how would that go?
Hearing what I what I just heard, I think I'd be happy to move forward.
I don't think it would be a waste of time for either of us.
I think, like, things are seemingly aligned, but, of course, since it is open ended,
I think it really would depend on the technical interview, how
things go, and all the things that I learned about the company. I think
if things there there's a good bidirectional alignment
I'm sure we we can end up with the right amount as well.
No. That's fair. Is there a number that you're, like, the absolute minimum I would accept
is this? Again, I don't think I would have a number, but I think, like,
the numbers that you've talked about right now, like, I'd be happy to proceed.
Hearing those numbers. Okay. Alright. Perfect.
Alright. Well, thank you so much, Avril. I do appreciate your time. And
happy to answer any questions that you may have at this point.
I had a quick question about, like,
about the company. Actually, that one, I'm, like, just looking at the notes, and that actually
was already answered by you about the labs because
said a new venture, but I looked at the company and it has, like,
a lot of, like, workers already like, developers already. Oh, wow.
Yeah. No. Sorry. So it's the labs thing. Right? I'm assuming. Yeah.
Exactly. Vuoban Labs. I do apologize, and I don't know if the job
description maybe hasn't been updated. But initially, when we started recruiting, of course, we didn't
anyone. Mhmm. But since then, it's been maybe
three months and we hired two people. Oh, okay. And now we're looking
for a third ideally before end of year. And next
year, we're probably going to double in size, maybe even triple. So that's where we're at at the moment.
Perfect. Sounds great. Yep. Cool. Awesome. Any other questions?
I just wanted to know in terms of, like,
how quick the process would be because I do like, I am an
a pipeline for, two other roles right now.
And there are, like, literally just now, I know if you heard the
sound, the notification sound, but I just heard back from another recruiter.
So Okay. I think, like, there will be, like,
like, I I can obviously keep you updated if there are any updates from my end.
But I would say I'm still in, like, early to intermediate
stages with other companies. But I'm wondering in terms of
from from your end, what does the
look like? Let's say, I I I know you had mentioned technical interview.
There are multiple stages.
Yes. So that's exactly what I was going to tell you. I really didn't draw my
my conversation with you and definitely would love to move you forward to that next round.
Especially with the I guess the
technical question, like I said, will be assessed with the
team, but I think the range that you gave me is very close to what we're looking for.
So I would love to move you forward to the next round, which, like I mentioned, would be
with me. And we schedule it for forty five minutes, but it could be anywhere between thirty minutes to an hour.
I would say allocate an hour of your time. Mhmm. And
I do have my calendar open, but I again, I understand, you know, I I do have a call right now, I
kept waiting a few minutes. If it's easier for you to send me an email with your availability,
even as early as tomorrow, I'm happy to meet tomorrow. And I'm pretty open pretty much
all day tomorrow, honestly, if that works for you.
Just send me your availability for, this week or early next.
I think I have two I have two interviews lined up for tomorrow, so I
I probably won't be able to, but I'll definitely send you my availability as
soon as possible and get back to
Perfect. Sounds great. And then from there, if that goes well the next
step would be a technical interview, and then the final step is an executive interview.
So you're looking about three more rounds in total. Okay.
I know, like, you have kept the other person waiting. I sincerely apologize for that. I just wanted
to know a little bit more about, like, the that if you could maybe send me a email,
about what to expect. Like, I know you mentioned, like, more details of the tech Yeah. So in the interview,
with me, it's just going to be very similar to this conversation, but we're really gonna dig in deeper in your back
background. You gave me quite a bit of detail about what you were doing at Amazon, but it's really just kinda looking at more
the successes and impacts that you've had in each of your past roles.
Well as asking a few behavioral and situational
questions. Like, if this happened, what would you do or tell me about it? So those kind of scenarios.
Mhmm. But that's really what it looks like. And then the next round
is technical, and that's where we really dig in deeper in your projects.
And technical expertise.
Sounds good. Alright. Thank you so much, Amar.
No problem. Thank you again, overall. I look forward to hearing from you and getting your availability, and I'll
schedule as soon as I can. But if you have any questions in the meantime, just feel free to reach out.
Sure thing. Thank you. It was a pleasure talking to you. Likewise.
Take care. Cheers. Bye.
.
So all of this above is the transcription.
