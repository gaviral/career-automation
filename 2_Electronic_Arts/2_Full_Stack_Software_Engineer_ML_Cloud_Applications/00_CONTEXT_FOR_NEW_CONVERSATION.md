## CRITICAL CONTEXT: TWO SEPARATE PROJECTS

**These are TWO DIFFERENT Amazon Beauty Tech projects (do NOT conflate):**

### Project 1: Project Scott (AI Documentation Q&A)
- **Description:** AI agent system answering team questions from internal documentation
- **Tech:** RAG pipeline, LLM, SageMaker (inference), Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, ticketing integration
- **Metrics:** 82% improvement, 240 dev-hrs/month saved, 100% documentation coverage
- **Use for:** "Walk us through an end-to-end ML cloud application" (Q1 - most likely question)
- **Source:** File 10, lines 125-126 (recruiter screen transcript)

### Project 2: VTO (Virtual Try-On / Visual Property Extraction)
- **Description:** Visual property extraction pipeline for AR virtual try-on experiences
- **Tech:** SageMaker Ground Truth (labeling), custom ML models (bounding boxes, color extraction), Step Functions, Lambda
- **Collaboration:** 6 teams - technical artists, designers, data scientists, PMs, 3D asset team, beauty brand bridge teams
- **Impact:** Replaced third-party tool, established org-wide standards, part of 40TB/day Beauty Tech data lake
- **Use for:** "Describe cross-functional collaboration" (Q2 - also very likely)
- **Source:** File 14 (entire ChatGPT conversation is ONLY about this project)

**See File 17 for detailed 30-45 second pitches for BOTH projects**

## KEY INSIGHTS FROM RECRUITER SCREEN (Tyler)

**What Tyler Emphasized (File 10):**
1. **Cross-functional collaboration** - "a big part of the role", need someone who "honestly, kind of enjoys that" (mentioned MULTIPLE times)
2. **Game dev / tech artist experience** - "BIG PLUS", "certainly a plus", "I would encourage you to talk about that"
3. **Interview format** - NOT a coding interview, focus on technical background discussion
4. **AWS experience** - Heavily emphasized (Lambda, SageMaker, API Gateway, DynamoDB)

**Tyler's Limitations (File 20):**
- Filling in for someone on parental leave
- "Somewhat new to this team" (~1 month)
- Explicitly deferred detailed questions: "I'll let them go into the details"
- Don't ask him questions beyond his knowledge

**Interview Format:**
- 1 hour with 3 people (Daniel, Blaze, Rhea)
- Technical background discussion
- Focus: Cloud full-stack, AI/ML, web apps, communication/collaboration
- NOT a coding test

## CRITICAL LEARNING POINTS (File 11)

**From recruiter screen self-reflection:**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **BE CONCISE** - Answer in 30-60 seconds, offer to elaborate (you rambled 2+ minutes when 30-45 seconds would work)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **WATCH INTERVIEWER CUES** - Stop when they say "Great" or "Perfect"
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **PRACTICE OUT LOUD** - Need to rehearse 5+ times before interview
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **DON'T OVER-EXPLAIN** - Answer the question, THEN pause. Let them ask for details.

**Use STAR method:** Situation (10s) + Task (10s) + Action (30s) + Result (10s) = 60 seconds total

---

## NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (File 18)

### Priority 1: Interviewer Research (CURRENT MILESTONE)
1. Research **Daniel Arguedas** on LinkedIn - Hiring Manager, Senior Technology Lead
   - Background, projects, technical expertise
   - What he cares about (hiring manager = overall fit, technical + behavioral)
2. Research **Blaze Wallber** on LinkedIn - Director of Production Operations & Technology
   - More senior, likely asks about leadership/collaboration
   - Operations & technology focus = scalability, reliability, cross-team coordination
3. Research **Rhea Lauzon** on LinkedIn - Associate Technical Director: Online Development
   - "Online Development" = multiplayer/online services?
   - Technical deep dives likely, cloud architecture, APIs, real-time systems
4. Update File 13 with findings
5. Tailor prep emphasis based on backgrounds

### Priority 2: Mock Interview Practice
- Round 1: End-to-end run, identify weak spots
- Round 2: Add depth to weak areas
- Round 3: Full realistic simulation
- Focus on Project Scott (30-45 sec) AND VTO project (30-45 sec) pitches

### Priority 3: Optional Tyler Email
- See File 20 for analysis (minimal follow-up OR skip entirely)

## YOUR STRENGTHS (Emphasize These)

1. ‚úÖ 5 years AWS + ML experience
2. ‚úÖ TWO strong projects demonstrating different competencies:
   - Project Scott = End-to-end ML cloud app with impressive metrics
   - VTO Project = Cross-functional collaboration with 6 teams including technical artists
3. ‚úÖ Technical artist collaboration (unique differentiator Tyler highlighted as BIG PLUS)
4. ‚úÖ Game dev experience (UBC capstone)
5. ‚úÖ Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK, 4-staged CI/CD)
6. ‚úÖ Scalability + Impact (82%, 240 dev-hrs, 100% docs, 40TB/day, 40M+ users)
