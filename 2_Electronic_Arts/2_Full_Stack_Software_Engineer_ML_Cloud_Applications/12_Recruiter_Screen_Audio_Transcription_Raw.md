## Transcription

**[00:00] Tyler:** I'm doing all right. Did you get my email?

**[00:02] Avi:** I did. I did. I did.

**[00:04] Tyler:** Okay, good. Apologies for that. It's been one of those mornings where I've just been behind on meetings running long and that sort of thing.

**[00:13] Avi:** Absolutely.

**[00:15] Tyler:** It's funny, when I build my calendar, I try to put little buffers in between meetings, but it doesn't always work out that way.

**[00:21] Avi:** Yeah, been there, done that.

**[00:25] Tyler:** Yeah, right on. This shouldn't take too long. So, assuming that you're still good to go, we should be great on time.

**[00:30] Avi:** Perfect.

**[00:36] Tyler:** Great. Again, I appreciate you taking a few minutes. I just had a few questions around your background and timeline and that sort of thing. Maybe a good place to dive in here a little bit is to tell me about your job search. Just from a timing perspective, I'm curious where we fit into it. Obviously, we're at day one right now with us. So, I'm curious if you're in the advanced stages elsewhere, have a pending offer, or any sort of deadline over the next few weeks that would be helpful for us to know about.

**[1:12] Avi:** Oh, absolutely. It was actually just two weeks ago when I actively went back into the market. So I do have very initial stages; you are the first HR call.

**[1:22] Tyler:** Okay.

**[1:28] Avi:** But I do have four or five of them lined up for next week. So that's where I'm at. I'm in early stages and I am still applying.

**[1:43] Tyler:** Okay. Sounds like we're in good shape, at least for the moment. So, if that changes and you need us to move faster, please let me know. We'll do our best to pick up the pace on our end. You never know if someone comes along and moves a little quicker.

**[2:01] Avi:** 100%. Actually, I forgot to mention there's one with Cardium, a company in Burnaby. With that one, I'm in intermediate stages. So, because it was an internal referral, they were skipping the HR call, the recruiter call, sorry. So, yeah, but it's still... I feel they mentioned three to six weeks. But I'll definitely let you know if there's anything, if I get to the offer stages with any of them. I'll be sure to let you know.

**[2:33] Tyler:** Perfect. Appreciate it. And where are you currently based out of?

**[2:42] Avi:** I'm in Port Coquitlam. So, I'm not sure if you know about the area, but it's close to Burnaby.

**[2:50] Tyler:** I do a little bit. I live in Seattle, so I'm not too far away, but I obviously support a lot of our teams in Vancouver, so I'm familiar with the area in that regard. I've been up there a few times and have been to Victoria as well. And I saw that on your resume. I just wanted to make sure, and I also wanted to make sure that you were aware that this is a hybrid role, and at least it will be. They made an announcement in May that we were going into return to office, and some locations... well, they weren't ready immediately, but as of this September, I think our office on Edward Shores went back to that model. And then other sites, Vancouver being one of them, were near capacity, so it might take some time. But I wanted to make sure you were aware and okay with that.

**[3:39] Avi:** 100%. It's less than half an hour from my place, the headquarters.

**[3:44] Tyler:** Oh, okay. Yeah. Great.

**[3:49] Avi:** Great.

**[3:50] Tyler:** Got it. Okay. Great. If we got through our process, if everything worked out and we made you an offer and you said yes, I'm curious how much time you would need before you'd be able to start or what would be ideal for you? Would it be a standard two to three weeks from the point of accepting an offer, or something different? What would be ideal for you?

**[4:07] Avi:** I'm very flexible on that because right now I'm not working. So that's why anytime would be good, as long as it's a good fit.

**[4:21] Tyler:** Yeah, and just for full transparency, we would need a minimum of two weeks on our end to get everything lined up, the onboarding process going smoothly and all that. That's why we build that time in, so it doesn't put too much stress on our IT and facilities to get things ready. So, just know if we did get there, we would need a minimum of two weeks before you'd be able to start.

**[4:47] Avi:** Of course. Yeah, sounds very standard.

**[4:53] Tyler:** Yeah. I know some smaller companies are like, 'Yeah, you could start on Monday.' We're not one of those; we can't do that.

**[5:02] Avi:** Okay.

**[5:03] Tyler:** And are you authorized to work in Canada?

**[5:05] Avi:** Yes, I am. I'm a Canadian citizen.

**[5:08] Tyler:** Got it.

**[5:09] Avi:** All good to go on that.

**[5:09] Tyler:** Okay. That's one of those questions I have to ask. Even 95% of the time, I'm sure I know the answer, but you never know.

**[5:15] Avi:** No, of course. Makes sense.

**[5:18] Tyler:** So, just walk me through your most recent role at a high level—basic responsibilities, that sort of thing.

**[5:27] Avi:** I was a software engineer at Amazon, with five years working there. Basic responsibilities were full stack AI, and I worked with several different serverless technologies. I led a team of eight engineers there, and even built some really great AI agents with internal documentation. On a very high level, it was mentoring new engineers, working with many different cross-functional teams: business intelligence engineers, ML engineers, and working with product managers, SDMs, and what not. Is that somewhat what you're looking for? I can go into a tiny bit more detail.

**[6:02] Tyler:** Yeah, that's exactly right. That is exactly what I was looking for. So thank you.

**[6:06] Avi:** Yeah.

**[6:19] Tyler:** Great. So, tell me a little bit about this role that you applied to and what made you throw your hat in the ring and want to talk to me today?

**[6:30] Avi:** Absolutely. One of the things is, here I felt like it was a great match. It was actually amongst one of the great matches where it was the tech stack that was there: Python, AWS, Lambda, SageMaker, DynamoDB, and the focus on AI tools, but using those to enhance experiences, like making things faster, because that's where I see myself thriving. There was one project I would quickly mention, which would be Project Scott, where I developed internal AI agents on internal documentation. And if you, let's say, were joining the BeautyTech team that I worked at at Amazon, you would have your whole good conversation meet-and-greets with everyone else. But if you had any technical question, you'd talk to Project Scott; you'd talk to Scott, the AI agent I built. It'll recognize what topics you are asking questions about, look up the documentation, and provide you the answer immediately. If it didn't find everything, it would just contact the subject matter expert, get that information, do the documentation for them, and respond back. And it got attached itself to the internal ticketing system. It got attached to pretty much everything in our team, and we reached 100% documentation. Why am I talking about this? It's because I'm very intrigued by doing full-stack development along with using all these AI tools and taking things all the way to the end, maintaining CICD pipelines. I felt like it was a natural match right here.

**[8:21] Tyler:** Yeah. That's great. And what you talked about earlier about the cross-functional team, I mean, I think that's a... for this group, it's a... they have their hands in a lot of different things at EA, so they support many different teams. And so that is a big part of that, is being able to communicate with folks in other orgs, in other parts of the org. Obviously, there's a technical baseline of skills that you need, but they really need someone who not only is able to work on their own, but to work cross-functionally and honestly, kind of enjoys that a little bit because sometimes folks want to have their head down and not work with other people. And this role would involve a lot of working with other people, so I love what you just said.

**[9:21] Avi:** 100%. That's one thing that I've always thrived at, whether it be my capstone projects, just leading the teams and being understanding, really working backward from the product, like what we really want, understanding, being empathetic about what... I've worked with game developers as well, tech artists in the past. And in my early years and at UBC where I studied, University of British Columbia, yeah, I had the chance to work with game developers. So not only did I lead the team on the technical aspects, but I was always the point of contact, kind of the bridge between assigning tasks to other engineers as well, saying, "This is what we really want. Let's not just..." like working with content creators and game developers and artists and really working from what really is the problem. Let's solve that instead of you telling me how to do what to do—which, of course, I'm still open to that as well, but it's the focus always being, "Hey, let's figure out what exactly needs to be done and let's get that done."

**[10:35] Tyler:** Right on. I love it. And as we go through the process, I would encourage you, if you have an opportunity, to talk about that—talk about working with tech artists and game devs. I think that while it's not a requirement for this role, it's certainly a plus. So that would be beneficial.

**[10:55] Avi:** Swell thing.

**[10:59] Tyler:** Yeah.

**[11:00] Avi:** Yeah, they're done.

**[11:01] Tyler:** Great. In terms of compensation, what are you targeting for your next role?

**[11:06] Avi:** For that, I would say I'm looking for a competitive package that reflects the five years of experience on my end, building cloud native apps and everything. I'm open to discussing the full compensation package: the base, equity, benefits. What range does EA typically offer for this role?

**[11:24] Tyler:** I was just going to say, I think our target—and I would need to confirm with the hiring team—but I think our target for this role is a base of around 120 to 125k. There's a 15% annual bonus, and then there is an RSU component as well. The RSUs fully vest in three years and that portion is paid out in USD. So, for folks that we hire in Canada, there's a bit of a benefit to that because of the exchange rate.

**[12:02] Avi:** Right.

**[12:08] Tyler:** But I don't know how that sounds or fits, or what your thoughts are there.

**[12:14] Avi:** I would say it's definitely something... I think as I learn more about the position, this would be something I'd say I'm happy to move forward with. It's not a deal breaker. But I think if there's a good match between what you guys are looking for at your end and what I'm looking for, I'm sure we can have some negotiation there.

**[12:43] Tyler:** Okay, no worries. I'm glad to hear that. I do want to let you know that will be something discussed by the hiring team in terms of what we're able to do. But it sounds like we're close enough to continue moving forward, at least at this time, and then we can certainly get into those details later on in the process.

**[13:06] Avi:** Exactly. And by the way, what you mentioned, was that in USD? Before the conversion, the range?

**[13:13] Tyler:** Not the base, no. The base is Canadian. The RSUs would be in USD.

**[13:21] Avi:** Got it. Okay. Oh, that was the base, right? Okay. Just as long as the...

**[13:26] Tyler:** 120, 120 to 125k base Canadian. 15% annual bonus. The bonus, just to give you some insight into that, there are three components that drive that, three qualifiers if you will: one is individual performance, another is team performance, and the other is company performance. Each one of those qualifiers could potentially go up to 200%. So, I've seen in my three and a half years here, I've seen the company piece pay out at as high as 126%. I've seen my individual TA team pay out at 114%, and my... you know, if you're in 'meet expectations', you're looking at 100% on the individual performance qualifier. If you're in the 'exceeds', then that can go north as well. I mean, I don't know how realistically you're going to get to 200%, but it's there. It's possible, I guess. But the point is, it's not capped at 15%. So if the team, company, and yourself do well, it can go above that 15%. And then the RSUs, I think our target is around 70k USD for a grant that fully vests in three years. And there are other components as well, but that's kind of what I think a target would look like.

**[14:47] Avi:** Let me put it this way, I'm very happy with what I'm hearing in terms of the compensation. The biggest attracting point for me in this was the great match that we have with the role and what I have to offer. So this was more so secondary, but obviously important, and I'm happy with that aspect as well.

**[15:10] Tyler:** Yeah, it's kind of a tough question to ask in the beginning, but also, if you don't broach that subject a little bit, then sometimes you do get to the end and you're off by a lot, where there can't be any negotiation. You learn pretty quickly if you don't at least talk a little bit about it, then you get to the end and no one's happy because the team's gone through interviews, the candidate's gone through interviews, and it's just not a good feeling. So I learned pretty quickly with that.

**[15:43] Avi:** Makes complete sense. I know what you're talking about. So that makes sense. We wouldn't want to waste each other's time, and I don't think that's the case here.

**[15:52] Tyler:** Well again, we don't have to drill down and say, "Okay, this is exactly what it's going to be." It's just again, just making sure that we're close enough to get to the end and then talk further about it.

**[16:00] Avi:** 100%. Makes sense.

**[16:07] Tyler:** Great. So, I would like to move you forward in the process and have you speak with the team as the next step. It'll be a one-hour interview. And what's going to happen next is I'm going to put everything in the system. You're going to get an email asking for your availability. So if you could provide, I would say for a two-week period of time, and give specifics, like say, you know, "Tuesday from three to four" or "Wednesday two to five," whatever. Essentially, once you submit that, that's going to go to my coordinator. Her name is Naomi. She'll get it scheduled with the team. Once it's scheduled, she'll send the invites and whatnot. And just know that if you provide two weeks of availability, she's going to schedule it in the first slot that's available where there's a match for everybody's calendar. So, yeah, that would be the next step. If that goes well, there's a panel interview afterwards. But yeah, that'll be next.

**[17:16] Avi:** Right. Could you go into a little bit more detail about the interview itself? Like what, just so that I have a good idea of what to expect?

**[17:26] Tyler:** I wouldn't say it's a technical interview, but they will want to know about your technical background and your experiences in cloud-based full-stack development, any AI solutions, ML models, web apps, things that you've worked on. Also, a big thing is going to be communication, collaboration. It's probably... I don't know specifically the types of questions they're asking, but I think they'll probably want to ask about standard type questions about when you worked in a team and wanting to hear some of the things that you relayed to me about the cross-functional teams, the communication. Obviously, I mentioned earlier, I'm sure they would love to hear about the experiences working with game devs and tech artists and things like that. So, yeah, I think that's kind of what the focus will be for the first interview.

**[18:22] Avi:** Right. And the interview is going to be with the hiring manager?

**[18:32] Tyler:** It's going to be with three people total, I should say two to three. So it'll be the hiring manager who oversees this group, and then one of the technical directors on the team, and possibly one more as well.

**[18:49] Avi:** Right, I see. I'm trying to just work backwards from exactly what they're looking for. Not exactly looking for the exact questions or anything like that, obviously. It's more so what is it that they're looking for? So who are the people who are going to interview me and what are they're looking for? From what I hear, it's learning more about the key components like communication and working in a cross-functional environment. Is there anything more specific that they're looking for in this particular position? Like, "Okay, this has to be a key thing," that kind of thing?

**[19:28] Tyler:** Yeah, I mean, I think any experience designing and implementing cloud-based applications across multiple languages—Python, JavaScript, etc. Also, working in full-stack and leveraging modern AI/ML technology, and working in AWS is obviously a big thing too. Or I guess it doesn't have to be AWS, but one of the major ones. But with AWS, I would assume working at Amazon, you probably...

**[20:07] Avi:** Yeah, my bread and butter.

**[20:07] Tyler:** ...you're familiar with it.

**[20:12] Avi:** Oh, yeah.

**[20:12] Tyler:** You've heard of it at least, right? And I think with this group, why it's kind of cool in my opinion is it's a marketing component that supports multiple different games, so they're not pigeonholed into one project, one game. There is an opportunity to work across so many different projects. And a lot of what they do is they go in, they produce... for one example, and they do many different things, but one example of things that they'll do is they'll go into a game engine of a game and they'll craft trailers that you see on TV and stuff for Battlefield and things like that, using super high-quality cinematics and things like that. And they work across many different technologies, so there's a huge opportunity for growth too, as far as that goes from a technical perspective. So, it's kind of cool. And full transparency, I'm somewhat new to this team. I'm actually just helping out. We have someone on, one of my peers is on a parental leave. So, as of about a month, I've been supporting this group and it's been cool to kind of learn about it because I hadn't had exposure to it. So I think that's one of the neat things that EA does provide. So is the opportunity like that? Because I typically support other studios like Full Circle, which just launched Skate in early access, and then I'm going to be with this hiring ramp for Battlefield 6. So, it's pretty cool. Any other questions I should say?

**[22:08] Avi:** Sorry if I'm taking too much of your time. I just was a little bit more curious about...

**[22:12] Tyler:** We got off to a late start, so all good.

**[22:16] Avi:** Okay, that's perfect. Yeah. You mentioned the marketing team, the marketing content... I saw in the job description, "the Marketing Content Production Craft team," right? So I'm just trying to put myself in their shoes. But you've already given me a great amount of information about exactly what they're doing. My last question about this would be, in terms of their mission statement, or almost what is it in one line, if they had to say, "This is what their mission is?" Sure, they're hiring many people and whatnot, but what do they want to do in the next, let's say, a month, three months, one year? I'm just trying to get that picture, and I'm hearing it's more about fan growth as well, from the job description.

**[23:13] Tyler:** Yeah, I'll let them go into the details of that. I mean, I don't think I've been supporting this team long enough to give a thorough answer. But I could tell you, from a, what they're looking for in a 60, 90, 120-day scenario and kind of how that ramp would look like for a new hire, I should say, is they are looking for someone who can design and implement tools that can improve efficiency, also working on and learning the Frostbite code base, fixing bugs, implementing new features, things like that. And working across multiple teams. And again, I'll let them go into more details about that. Again, partially because I got to be careful. During this next step when I send out the email, you're going to get an NDA as well to sign, and they'll go into... I always leave it on the hiring manager because it's at that first interview. As you can imagine in the gaming space, there is a lot of NDA-related things. A lot of what we talk about is not public knowledge. I supported an unannounced project for about a year and a half before I could talk about it, and it was hard.

**[24:41] Avi:** I can imagine.

**[24:42] Tyler:** I just had a little sign taped above my computer, just a reminder like, "Hey, be careful who you're talking to." Because I never want to be the person that lets something slip, and so I usually lean in that direction. And then, once we have the NDA in place too, they're obviously able to more freely speak about that.

**[25:00] Avi:** That completely makes sense. I think your answers did help me understand exactly, because there's always so much to talk about and it will help me filter and kind of position myself to exactly demonstrate my skill set that would be best suited for this. And all the information that you gave me, I think could be very, very helpful for that.

**[25:28] Tyler:** Great, great. All right. Well, hey, I'll let you go if you don't have anything else. Be on the lookout for that email today. If I would say if you don't, you should get it pretty quickly. But if you don't receive it by end of day, go ahead and shoot me an email and follow up with me Monday morning, and we'll track it down. But again, you should receive it pretty soon.

**[25:50] Avi:** Sounds good.

**[25:54] Tyler:** All right. Hey, have a good weekend. We'll talk soon, all right?

**[25:56] Avi:** Thank you, Tyler. I appreciate you answering all the questions.

**[26:01] Tyler:** Of course. Of course.

**[26:02] Avi:** Thank you.

**[26:03] Tyler:** All right. Take care.

**[26:04] Avi:** Take care. Bye.

**[26:05] Tyler:** Bye.
