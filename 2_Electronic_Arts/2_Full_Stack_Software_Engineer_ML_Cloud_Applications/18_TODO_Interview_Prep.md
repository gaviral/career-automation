## üéØ FOCUS FOR NEXT 24 HOURS

**Top 5 Priorities (Updated based on interviewer research):**
1. **PRACTICE OUT LOUD** - This is the #1 learning point from recruiter screen
2. **Master VTO 6-team collaboration story** - Blaze (Director) NEEDS to hear this
3. **Prepare deep technical AWS answers** - Rhea will ask detailed architecture questions
4. **Practice game dev context connections** - Connect your work to game dev for Daniel
5. **Prepare tailored questions for each interviewer** - See File 13 for specific strategies

**Remember from File 15:**
- BE CONCISE: 30-60 seconds, offer to elaborate
- WATCH CUES: Stop when they say "Great" or "Perfect"
- DON'T RAMBLE: You spent 2+ minutes on Project Scott in recruiter screen when 30-45 seconds would work

**Key Strategy Shifts Based on Interviewer Research:**
- **More emphasis on VTO Project** - Blaze wants cross-functional collaboration (mentioned MULTIPLE times by Tyler)
- **Deep technical prep for Rhea** - She's a backend/cloud expert, expect AWS architecture deep dive
- **Connect to game dev for Daniel** - He's worked on Madden for 12+ years, show understanding of game dev infrastructure

**You've got this! üöÄ**
