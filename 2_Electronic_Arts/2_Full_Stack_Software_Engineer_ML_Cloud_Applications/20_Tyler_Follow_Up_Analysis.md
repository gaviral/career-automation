# Tyler Follow-Up Email Analysis
**Date:** October 8, 2025

---

## CONTEXT FROM RECRUITER SCREEN (File 10)

### What Tyler Knows
- **His role:** Filling in for a peer on parental leave
- **Team familiarity:** "Somewhat new to this team" (~1 month supporting this group)
- **Interview format:** Confirmed it's NOT a coding interview, focus on technical background
- **General focus areas:** Cross-functional collaboration, game dev/tech artist experience (BIG PLUS), AWS, AI/ML
- **Interviewers:** Confirmed 3 people (Hiring Manager, Technical Director, possibly one more)

### What Tyler Explicitly Said He DOESN'T Know
- **Team mission details:** "I'll let them go into the details of that. I don't think I've been supporting this team long enough to give a thorough answer."
- **Specific technical questions:** "I don't know specifically the types of questions they're asking"
- **Project details:** Mentioned NDA requirement before detailed discussions

### Tyler's Guidance Strategy
- Deferred detailed questions to the actual interviewers
- Said "I always leave it on the hiring manager" for detailed discussions
- Mentioned they can talk more after NDA is signed

## INTERVIEWER NAMES PROVIDED (File 13)

1. **Daniel Arguedas** - Hiring Manager, Senior Technology Lead
2. **Blaze Wallber** - Director of Production Operations & Technology
3. **Rhea Lauzon** - Associate Technical Director: Online Development

---

## ANALYSIS: SHOULD WE EMAIL TYLER?

### Questions Tyler CAN Answer
1. ✅ **Logistics confirmation** - "Just to confirm, the interview is still 1 hour with all 3 of you on the call?"
2. ✅ **Format clarification** - "Will there be any screen sharing or whiteboarding component?"
3. ✅ **Preparation guidance** - "Is there anything specific I should prepare differently knowing the interviewers?"

### Questions Tyler CANNOT Answer (Don't Ask)
1. ❌ Specific technical topics they'll focus on
2. ❌ Detailed team projects or current initiatives
3. ❌ Individual interviewer's specific focus areas
4. ❌ What questions each person will ask

---

## RECOMMENDATION

### Option A: MINIMAL FOLLOW-UP (RECOMMENDED)
Send a brief thank-you email with 1-2 logistical questions Tyler can actually answer.

**Rationale:**
- Tyler has limited knowledge (filling in, ~1 month with team)
- He already deferred detailed questions to the interviewers themselves
- We have enough info to prepare effectively
- Better to research interviewers independently (LinkedIn)
- Don't burden Tyler with questions he can't answer

**Suggested Email:**
```
Hi Tyler,

Thanks so much for sharing the interviewer names! I really appreciate it.

Just two quick logistical questions:
1. Will the interview be structured with each person asking questions sequentially, or more of a conversational format?
2. Is there any screen sharing or whiteboarding component I should prepare for?

Thanks again for all your help. Looking forward to Thursday!

Best,
Aviral
```

### Option B: SKIP FOLLOW-UP (ALSO VALID)
Don't email Tyler at all. We have sufficient information:
- 3 interviewers with names and titles
- Interview format (1 hour, technical background discussion, not coding)
- Focus areas (cross-functional, AWS, AI/ML, game dev experience)
- Can research interviewers independently on LinkedIn

**Rationale:**
- Tyler already provided what he knows
- Further questions would be beyond his knowledge
- We can prepare effectively with current info
- Shows independence and resourcefulness

## NEXT STEPS (REGARDLESS OF TYLER EMAIL)

### Priority 1: Research Interviewers (LinkedIn)
- **Daniel Arguedas** (Hiring Manager, Senior Technology Lead)
  - Background, projects, what he cares about
  - His technical expertise areas
  - How long at EA, previous roles
  
- **Blaze Wallber** (Director of Production Operations & Technology)
  - More senior, likely asks about leadership/collaboration
  - Operations & technology focus = scalability, reliability
  - May ask about cross-team coordination
  
- **Rhea Lauzon** (Associate Technical Director: Online Development)
  - "Online Development" = multiplayer/online services?
  - Technical deep dives likely
  - May focus on cloud architecture, APIs, real-time systems

### Priority 2: Tailor Prep Based on Interviewer Backgrounds
- Once we know their backgrounds, adjust emphasis
- Daniel (Hiring Manager) = overall fit, technical + behavioral
- Blaze (Director) = leadership, cross-functional, operations
- Rhea (Associate Tech Director) = technical depth, architecture

### Priority 3: Disambiguate Projects
- Clarify Project Scott vs Virtual Try-On (File 14 is ONLY about VTO)
- Update files 16 and 17 with correct project details

## MY RECOMMENDATION

**Option A (Minimal Follow-Up)** - Send brief thank-you with 1-2 logistical questions.

**Why:**
- Professional courtesy (thank him for interviewer names)
- 1-2 simple questions show thoughtfulness without overburdening
- Keeps communication open
- Questions are answerable even with limited team knowledge

**What NOT to ask:**
- Don't ask about specific technical topics
- Don't ask about team projects/initiatives
- Don't ask what each interviewer will focus on
- Don't ask for insider tips Tyler doesn't have

**Focus energy on:**
- LinkedIn research of 3 interviewers (we have names now!)
- Project clarification (Scott vs VTO)
- Mock interview practice with tailored prep
