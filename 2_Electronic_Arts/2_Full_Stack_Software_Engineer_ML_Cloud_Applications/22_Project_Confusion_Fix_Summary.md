# Project Confusion Fix - Complete Summary
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

Files 16 and 17 had conflated TWO SEPARATE Amazon Beauty Tech projects:
1. **Project Scott** - AI Documentation Q&A System
2. **VTO Project** - Visual Property Extraction for AR Try-Ons

**Root cause:** File 14 (ChatGPT conversation) was ONLY about VTO project, but File 17 was titled "Project Scott Story" and mixed metrics from both projects.

---

## FIXES APPLIED

### File 16: Interview_Prep_Comprehensive_Guide.md
**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added warning at top: "TWO SEPARATE PROJECTS" with usage guidance
2. ✅ **Q1 (End-to-End ML Cloud App):** Now uses **Project Scott** with correct details:
   - AI Documentation Q&A system
   - RAG pipeline, vector embeddings, LLM
   - 82% improvement, 240 dev-hrs saved, 100% docs
3. ✅ **Q2 (Cross-Functional Collaboration):** Now uses **VTO Project** with correct details:
   - Visual property extraction for AR try-on
   - 6 teams: tech artists, designers, data scientists, PMs, 3D asset team, beauty brand teams
   - Established org-wide standards
4. ✅ Q3 updated: References both projects appropriately
5. ✅ Q4 updated: VTO project for tech artist collaboration
6. ✅ Updated strengths section: Lists both projects correctly
7. ✅ Updated checklist: Practice BOTH project pitches

### File 17: Project_Story_Details.md
**Complete rewrite:**
1. ✅ Clear header: "TWO SEPARATE PROJECTS"
2. ✅ **Section 1: Project Scott (AI Documentation Q&A)**
   - 30-45 second core story
   - Expansion details if asked
   - Correct metrics: 82%, 240 dev-hrs, 100% docs
   - RAG pipeline, SageMaker, ticketing integration
   - Usage guidance: For "End-to-End ML Cloud App" question
3. ✅ **Section 2: Virtual Try-On (VTO Project)**
   - 30-45 second core story
   - Detailed expansion including all 6 teams
   - Correct details: No conflation with Project Scott metrics
   - Usage guidance: For "Cross-Functional Collaboration" question
4. ✅ Strategic usage section: When to use which project

## VERIFICATION

### Project Scott (AI Documentation Q&A) - Verified Details
**Source of Truth:** File 10 (Recruiter Screen Transcription), lines 125-126

**Correct Details:**
- AI agents powered by internal documentation
- "Talk to Project Scott" - named interface
- Answered CI/CD, admin questions
- Attached to internal ticketing system
- Reached 100% documentation (led org-wide workshop)
- 82% improvement in resolution time
- 240 dev-hours/month saved

**Technologies:**
- RAG pipeline (vector embeddings, retrieval)
- LLM for natural language Q&A
- SageMaker for model hosting (inference)
- Lambda, API Gateway (likely)
- DynamoDB for session state
- Ticketing system integration
- CloudWatch/X-Ray monitoring

---

### VTO Project (Visual Property Extraction) - Verified Details
**Source of Truth:** File 14 (entire ChatGPT conversation)

**Correct Details:**
- Visual property extraction from product images for AR try-ons
- Replace costly third-party tool
- Non-standard product photo submissions problem
- Worked with 6 teams/disciplines:
  1. Technical artists (rendering team)
  2. Designers
  3. Data scientists / applied scientists
  4. Product managers
  5. 3D asset creation team (external)
  6. Beauty brand bridge teams
- Established org-wide standards (naming, photo standards, RGB values)
- Conducted double-blind experiments with diverse demographics
- Worked backward from real problems

**Technologies:**
- SageMaker Ground Truth (data labeling)
- Custom ML models (bounding boxes, color extraction)
- Event-driven pipeline (product catalog changes)
- Step Functions + Lambda orchestration
- DynamoDB / S3 storage
- AWS CDK + CloudFormation
- CloudWatch/X-Ray monitoring

**Impact:**
- Replaced third-party tool
- Established standards for future partners
- High data quality validated through experiments
- Part of larger Beauty Tech data lake (40TB/day, 40M+ users)

**Note:** The 40TB/day and 40M+ users metrics are from the larger Beauty Tech data lake that this pipeline fed into, NOT exclusive to VTO project.

## KEY DISTINCTIONS

| Aspect | Project Scott | VTO Project |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Focus** | AI Q&A for documentation | Visual property extraction |
| **Problem** | Scattered docs, repeated questions | Costly third-party tool, non-standard photos |
| **ML Type** | RAG, LLM, NLP | Computer vision, bounding boxes, color extraction |
| **Main Collaboration** | Engineers, SMEs | 6 teams including technical artists |
| **Unique Metrics** | 82%, 240 dev-hrs, 100% docs | Established org-wide standards, experiments |
| **Best For** | "End-to-End ML Cloud App" question | "Cross-Functional Collaboration" question |
| **Tyler's Reaction** | Heard in recruiter screen, was impressed | Not mentioned in recruiter screen |

## USAGE STRATEGY (Final)

### For EA Interview

**Q1: "Walk us through an end-to-end ML cloud application..."**
→ **Use: Project Scott**
- Cleaner end-to-end narrative
- Clear ML/AI focus (RAG, LLM, SageMaker)
- Impressive, specific metrics
- Tyler already heard it and liked it

**Q2: "Describe cross-functional collaboration..."**
→ **Use: VTO Project**
- 6 different teams/disciplines
- Technical artists explicitly mentioned (BIG PLUS per Tyler)
- Shows standards creation, long-term thinking
- Complex multi-team coordination

**Can Reference Both:**
- If asked multiple questions, mention both projects
- Shows breadth of experience
- Both are legitimate, impressive, at-scale projects
