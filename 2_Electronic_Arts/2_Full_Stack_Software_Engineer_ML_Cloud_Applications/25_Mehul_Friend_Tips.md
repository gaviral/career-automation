## 🎯 KEY ADVICE FROM MEHUL

### Note-Taking Strategy

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Read from full scripts or long paragraphs
- ❌ Have notes visible that look like you're reading

**DO:**
- ✅ Use **single words or short phrases** as memory triggers
- ✅ Place sticky notes around monitor with key words
- ✅ Example: Just see the word, remember the full context
- ✅ This helps answers sound natural, not rehearsed

**Mehul's Approach:**
- Had sticky notes with individual words around monitor
- Would glance at word, remember full point
- Sounded conversational, not like reading

### Answer Structure Strategy

**Mention Keywords, Let Them Probe:**

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Mention the job description explicitly ("This matches the job description")
- ❌ Go into too much detail upfront
- ❌ Try to cover everything in opening answer

**DO:**
- ✅ **Mention key concepts/technologies** they're looking for
- ✅ Say them **concisely and precisely**
- ✅ **Let interviewers ask follow-up questions**
- ✅ Wait for specific opportunities to elaborate

**Example:**
- Instead of saying "Infrastructure as Code matches the job description"
- Just naturally mention "I've worked extensively with Infrastructure as Code using CloudFormation and AWS CDK"
- STOP. Let them ask "Tell me more about your IaC experience"

**Why This Works:**
- Lights up interviewer's eyes when they hear relevant keywords
- Gives them control to probe deeper into what interests them
- Sounds more natural and conversational
- Tyler did this in recruiter screen - eyes lit up when you mentioned technical artists

### Wait for Follow-Up Opportunities

**Strategy:**
- If you forget a keyword in one answer, **don't worry**
- **Smart interviewers will infer** from context
- Bring it up naturally in **next answer**
- Example: "Oh, I forgot to mention, another aspect was..."

**Don't Force It:**
- Don't awkwardly shoehorn keywords if they don't fit naturally
- Interviewers who have done the work will understand the full picture
- Recruiter looks for keywords; technical people look for understanding

---

### Be a Fan Strategy

**Mehul's Suggestion:**
- Mention you're a **FIFA player** (EA game)
- Frame it as: "I myself have been a fan of EA games"
- Connect to: "I follow the fan's journey, now I want to create more fans"
- Tie to **User Experience (UX)** perspective
- "I resonate with creating stellar experiences for fans"

**Why This Works:**
- Shows genuine interest in EA's products
- Connects to Fan Growth team mission
- Demonstrates you understand the customer/fan perspective
- Not just technical skills, but passion for the domain

### Interviewer Research Insights

**From Mehul's Perspective:**

When he heard the three interviewers' backgrounds:
- **Daniel Arguedas (Hiring Manager):** Senior Technical Lead, Madden NFL work
- **Blaze Wallber (Director):** Production Operations & Technology, global studios
- **Rhea Lauzon (Technical Director):** Backend server programming, online development

**Mehul's Take:**
- These are **senior, technical people**
- They'll **infer** understanding from how you talk about projects
- Don't need to spell out every keyword
- Focus on demonstrating deep technical understanding
- They care about **how you think**, not just keyword matching
