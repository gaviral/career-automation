## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEHUL'S FINAL ADVICE: DON'T HYPEROPTIMIZE

**You've done the work. You know this. Don't practice too much now - diminishing returns.**

**Strategy:**
- **Have VTO story in one tab** (File 30 - your primary)
- **Have Project Scott in another tab** (File 30 - secondary, only if asked)
- **Take a break**
- **Read this 20 minutes before interview**
- **That's it**

## üí¨ Q1: "TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF" (~2 min, DON'T GO OVERBOARD)

**Memory Triggers:** Amazon 5yrs ‚Üí 8 engineers ‚Üí 40TB 40M ‚Üí Python AWS ‚Üí Technical artists ‚Üí FIFA fan

*I'm a* **full-stack software engineer** *with* **5 years at Amazon** *specializing in* **cloud-native ML applications on AWS**.

*At* **Amazon Beauty Tech**, *I* **led a team of 8 engineers** *building* **AI-powered systems** *that processed* **40TB/day**, *serving* **40M+ monthly customers** *across* **15 countries**.

*My technical foundation is* **Python** *and* **AWS serverless architecture**‚Äî**Lambda, SageMaker, API Gateway, DynamoDB**‚Äî*and* **Infrastructure as Code** *with* **CloudFormation**.

*What I really enjoy is* **cross-functional collaboration**. *I've worked extensively with* **technical artists**, **designers**, **data scientists**, **product managers**. *At UBC, I led a* **game development capstone** *where I was the* **bridge between engineers and creative teams**.

## üé® Q2: "WALK ME THROUGH A PROJECT" - USE VTO

**Go to File 30, Phase-by-Phase**

**Key Points to Hit:**
- ‚úÖ **Technical artists FIRST** in cross-team collaboration
- ‚úÖ **Data-driven experiments** (40‚Üí80 people, 23%‚Üí93%)
- ‚úÖ **Working backward** (improved photo submissions at source)
- ‚úÖ **50% turnaround improvement** (2 days ‚Üí 1 day)
- ‚úÖ **Foundation reused pipeline** (extensibility)
- ‚úÖ **Org-wide standards** (lasting impact)

**Watch for cues** - if they say "Great" or start asking specific questions, stop the chronological walkthrough and answer their questions.

## üôã QUESTIONS TO ASK THEM

### Question 1 (To All Three):

*"What does success look like to you for this role?"*

**Strategy:**
- Ask to **all three of you** (don't set order)
- They may have different answers
- Shows you care about their perspective

### Question 2 (If They All Say Same Thing):

*"If you were starting out today in this role, what learnings would you want to share?"*

**Strategy:**
- **Change the order** - ask the last person who answered first to go first this time
- Creates pressure for different answer
- Example: *"X, do you want to kick us off on this one?"*

### Backup Questions (If Time):

**For Daniel:**
*"You've worked on Madden NFL for many years‚Äîwhat's been the most interesting technical challenge?"*

**For Blaze:**
*"How do you coordinate across EA's global studios‚Äîany recent collaboration successes?"*

**For Rhea:**
*"What AWS technologies is the team most excited about adopting?"*

**General:**
*"What do you enjoy most about working at EA?"*

## üéØ KEY CONFIDENCE BOOSTERS

**From Mehul:**

1. **40M+ monthly customers** - "That's a lot of consumers. Big data point. You're already in good standing."

2. **You've done the work** - "This was basically the interview already. You've thought about everything."

3. **Details show authenticity** - "When you go into these details, I know you actually did it. Not someone who just read about it."

4. **You were good even without over-practicing** - "Even without practicing, you were good. Don't do too much."

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS

### From Mehul (Final):
- **Don't hyperoptimize now** - you've done enough
- **Practice has diminishing returns** - you already did well in mock
- **Take a break** - clear your head
- **Read this 20 min before** - refresh memory
- **Don't spend now till 1PM writing/practicing**

### From Learning Points (File 11):
- **BE CONCISE** - 30-60 seconds for most answers, ~2 min for "tell me about yourself"
- **WATCH CUES** - stop when they say "Great"
- **DON'T RAMBLE** - let them guide with questions

### From Tyler (File 10):
- ‚úÖ **Cross-functional collaboration** (he said this MULTIPLE times)
- ‚úÖ **Technical artists** ("certainly a plus", "encourage you to talk about")
- ‚úÖ **This is NOT a coding interview** - technical background discussion
