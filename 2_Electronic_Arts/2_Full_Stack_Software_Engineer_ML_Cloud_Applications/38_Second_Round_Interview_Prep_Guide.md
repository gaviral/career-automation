### Visualization
Before interview:
1. Close eyes, deep breath
2. Picture yourself confidently explaining VTO architecture
3. See interviewers nodding, engaged
4. Feel the excitement about EA's mission
5. Open eyes, begin

### Post-Interview
Regardless of outcome:
- Send thank-you note within 24 hours
