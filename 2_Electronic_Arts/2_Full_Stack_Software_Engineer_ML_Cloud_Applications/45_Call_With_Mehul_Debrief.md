**Interview Date:** Oct 9, 2025, 1:00 PM PDT  
**Interview Result:** Went really well! 🎉

---

## 📞 CALL STRUCTURE

### Opening (30 sec):
"Hey Mehul! So the interview just finished and it went REALLY well. I wanted to call you right away because so much of your advice directly helped. Can I walk you through what happened and where your tips made a huge difference?"

---

## 🎯 HOW MEHUL'S ADVICE HELPED (Tell Her This)

### 1. **Note-Taking Strategy - WORKED PERFECTLY**

**What You Did:**
- I had single-word triggers around my screen (not full paragraphs)
- Key words like "Athena," "Step Functions," "technical artists," "93%"
- Would glance at word, remember full context

**What Happened:**
- Answers sounded completely natural and conversational
- Not like I was reading from a script
- Could make eye contact with camera (not looking down at notes)

**Tell Mehul:**
> "Your sticky note advice was gold. I had trigger words around my monitor and it made SUCH a difference. I could glance at 'Athena' and remember the whole cost optimization story. They never once looked like I was reading—it was just conversational."

---

### 2. **"Mention Keywords, Let Them Probe" - THIS WAS THE GAME CHANGER**

**What You Did:**
- Mentioned key concepts concisely in intro
- Then stopped and waited
- Didn't try to explain everything upfront

**What Happened:**
- When I mentioned "Step Functions orchestration," Daniel leaned in
- When I said "worked with technical artists on rendering team," Blaze's interest visibly peaked
- When I mentioned "operational readiness review," Rhea said "tell me more about that"

**Tell Mehul:**
> "Your 'mention keywords, let them probe' strategy was EXACTLY right. When I mentioned Step Functions, Daniel immediately asked me to elaborate. When I said 'technical artists,' Blaze jumped in with questions. They guided the conversation to what THEY cared about, instead of me guessing. I literally watched their eyes light up when certain keywords hit."

---

### 3. **Answer Structure - Staying Concise**

**What You Did:**
- Kept "Tell me about yourself" to ~2 minutes
- For VTO project, gave 45-second overview first
- Asked "I can go deeper into any aspect—should I?"

**What Happened:**
- Daniel said "yeah, pretty much" after my overview
- He then asked about specific challenges
- This let me go deep on WHAT THEY CARED ABOUT (scalability, architecture decisions)
- Not what I thought they'd care about

**Tell Mehul:**
> "I started to go chronological through VTO, but caught myself. Asked 'am I going in the right direction?' Daniel said 'focus on challenges and decisions you made.' So I pivoted right there. If I'd rambled through the whole timeline, I would have wasted their time. Your advice to watch for cues and let THEM guide saved me."

**Key Moment - SELF-AWARENESS:**
- You almost started rambling about the whole VTO timeline
- Caught yourself mid-sentence
- Asked "is this what you're looking for?"
- Daniel redirected to challenges and architecture
- You adapted immediately

**Tell Mehul:**
> "I actually started to ramble through the chronology and STOPPED myself mid-sentence. Asked 'am I going in the right direction?' He wanted challenges and architecture decisions, not a timeline. I pivoted immediately. If I hadn't practiced being concise with you, I would have info-dumped for 10 minutes."

---

### 4. **Being a FIFA Fan - CONNECTED EMOTIONALLY**

**What You Did:**
- Mentioned in intro: "As a FIFA player and fan myself, I resonate with creating stellar fan experiences"
- Said "EA Sports. It's in the game" memory as a kid

**What Happened:**
- Casual atmosphere immediately
- They nodded, smiled
- Rhea mentioned they're launching Battlefield 6 tomorrow (!)
- Created common ground beyond just technical skills

**Tell Mehul:**
> "When I mentioned being a FIFA player, the mood shifted. It wasn't just technical interview anymore—it was like 'oh, you actually care about our products.' Rhea even shared they're launching Battlefield 6 tomorrow and the energy was so excited. Your advice to frame it as fan journey → creating more fans connected emotionally, not just technically."

---

### 5. **"Don't Hyperoptimize" - YOU WERE RIGHT**

**What You Did:**
- Took a break after mock with you
- Didn't practice for 2 hours straight
- Just reviewed trigger words 20 min before
- Went in fresh, not over-rehearsed

**What Happened:**
- Felt energized, not drained
- Answers felt spontaneous, not scripted
- Could adapt to their questions naturally
- Didn't sound robotic

**Tell Mehul:**
> "You were SO right about not hyperoptimizing. After our mock, I took a break, ate lunch, just reviewed trigger words before the call. I went in fresh. If I'd spent 2 hours practicing, I would have sounded robotic. Instead, I was conversational and could adapt when they steered the conversation."

---

## 📋 HOW THE INTERVIEW WENT (Chronological for Mehul)

### Opening Small Talk (First 5 min):

**What Happened:**
- Joined 2 min early, waited for everyone
- Rhea mentioned Battlefield 6 launching tomorrow (!!)
- I said "I can imagine, been there in that situation many times"
- She laughed, said "calm before the storm"
- Casual, friendly tone set immediately

**Mehul's Advice at Play:**
- FIFA fan connection worked right away
- Showed genuine interest in their work
- Not just "I want this job," but "I care about what you do"

---

### Introductions (5-8 min):

**Their Roles:**
- **Blaze:** Director of Operations & Technology for marketing (operations tools, workflows for artists)
- **Daniel:** Tech lead on Blaze's team (tools for artist productivity, Frostbite plugins, game capture, hiring for AI/ML)
- **Rhea:** Tech Director SRE (EA app, e-commerce, here for cloud/scaling/reliability perspective)

**My Intro (Your Advice Shined Here):**
- 5 years Amazon → 8 engineers → 40TB/40M customers → Python AWS
- Cross-functional: technical artists, designers, data scientists, PMs
- UBC capstone: bridge between engineers and creative teams
- Excited about EA: perfect technical match + enjoy working with creative teams + FIFA fan

**What Happened:**

- Mentioned keywords: Lambda, SageMaker, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Infrastructure as Code
- **Blaze's eyes lit up** when I said "technical artists"
- **Daniel nodded** at "AWS serverless"
- **Rhea smiled** at "cloud-native ML applications"

**Tell Mehul:**
> "The intro was EXACTLY 2 minutes. I hit every keyword naturally. When I said 'technical artists,' I literally saw Blaze lean forward. Your advice to just mention keywords and let them probe—they were already mentally queuing up questions."

---

### VTO Project Discussion (Main Event - 30 min):

**How It Started:**
- Daniel: "Tell me about your projects. Mix of greenfield vs maintenance?"
- Me: "Let me tell you about VTO—built from scratch"
- Gave 45-second overview (AR lipstick try-on, replace third-party, my role)

**Daniel's First Probe (Architecture):**
- "If the tech stack is relevant, explain the architecture"
- This was the GREEN LIGHT to go deep
- I explained Step Functions + Lambda + Athena + SageMaker

**Key Moments:**

**1. Blaze Asked About Data Quality (Exactly Her Concern!):**
- "Were you setting parameters for storefront owners or retrofitting?"
- This is HER domain (operations, workflows)
- I explained working backward: changed vendor requirements (1 year timeline) + built pipeline for existing bad data (93% success)
- She said "Right. Cool."

**Tell Mehul:**
> "Blaze asked about data quality and vendor management—EXACTLY her domain as Director of Operations. Your advice to let them probe what THEY care about meant I got to shine on HER specific interest. If I'd just rambled chronologically, I might have buried that point."

**2. Daniel Loved the Modular Design:**
- Asked about challenges
- I explained modular approach: human labelers → SageMaker endpoints swap
- He nodded throughout
- I could tell this matched his thinking (he's building new tools, wants flexibility)

**3. Rhea DEEP DIVED on Scalability (THIS WAS HER THING):**

**Her First Question:**
- "40TB data per day—did you run into scaling issues in lambdas, step functions?"
- THIS IS HER EXPERTISE (SRE, scalability)
- I explained Athena + Parquet solution vs expensive Kinesis
- Mentioned Glue and Data Pipelines failed cost/scale tests

**Her Second Question (The Best Part):**
- "Were there issues 70-80% through implementation? Feature complete but not scaling?"
- I explained Japan expansion bee image issue (extensibility problem, not scaling)
- Said "I'm very happy I can't think of major late-stage failures because of upfront planning"

**Her Third Question (Operational Readiness - She LOVED This):**
- "How were you thinking about scalability? Specific requirements?"
- I explained Amazon ORR: exponential backoff, X-ray tracing, cold start mitigation, modular plug-and-play
- Mentioned worldwide expansion roadmap influenced design choices

**HER REACTION:**
- **Rhea: "That is a very good answer. Thank you so much."**
- THIS WAS THE MOMENT

**Tell Mehul:**
> "Rhea asked three deep scalability questions. She's SRE, this is HER thing. I got to explain ORR checklist, X-ray tracing, exponential backoff. When I finished, she said 'That is a very good answer. Thank you so much.' I FELT that was the turning point. Your advice to let them probe meant Rhea got to ask HER questions and I crushed them."

**4. Unity/Game Dev Question:**
- Daniel asked about Unity or 3D math experience
- I explained UBC HoloLens project (neuroscience) and Memory Palace VR (Japanese learning)
- Admitted "no professional experience but university projects"
- He said "Good enough. Sounds interesting."

**5. Project Scott (Documentation):**
- Blaze: "Any other projects?"
- I mentioned Project Scott prototype
- **Blaze IMMEDIATELY:** "I have a lot of complaints about documentation internally."
- Explained RAG + Pinecone + LLM + SME routing
- She loved the legacy data handling discussion

**Tell Mehul:**
> "Blaze has the SAME documentation pain point! When I mentioned Project Scott, she literally said 'I have a lot of complaints about documentation internally.' I wasn't even planning to go deep on Scott, but your 'let them probe' advice meant I could pivot to what SHE cared about."

---

### Their Questions Setup (15 min):

**Blaze Explained Team Structure:**
- Marketing group: screenshots, videos, trailers, live action
- Tech designers: day-to-day artist support
- Software engineering: forward-thinking, long-term tools
- Everyone working together for efficiency

**Daniel Clarified Role:**
- New use cases: production tracking, document generation, render validation
- Need someone autonomous (no ML experts on team yet)
- Exploring AI/ML space
- Design solutions, preview risks, foresee scalability

**Blaze Emphasized:**
- "Looking for thought starter"
- "Guidance is relatively loose"
- "Help guide next phase"
- "What the person wants to make out of it"
- "Experiment and pivot with us"

**Rhea Added (Collaboration Theme):**
- EA has many teams working on AI/ML in silos
- Want collaboration across teams
- Share information, curiosity, learning
- Build healthy community (avoid duplication)

---

### MY Question to Them: "What does success look like?"

**Daniel's Answer:**
- Autonomy, understand user needs, design optimal solutions
- Preview risks, foresee scalability
- Establish new AI problem-solving approaches

**Blaze's Answer:**
- Collaborate with tech/artist teams
- Find smart scalability through AI
- Thought starter, guide next development phase
- Excited about applying tech, experiment, pivot

**Rhea's Answer:**
- Collaborate across EA teams
- Share information and curiosity
- Build healthy AI/ML community
- Interface with existing talent, build bridges

**Tell Mehul:**
> "Your advice to ask them questions back was perfect. I asked 'what does success look like?' to all three. They each had different answers based on their role! Daniel = autonomy, Blaze = collaboration, Rhea = community building. This gave me SO much insight into what they each valued."

---

### Follow-Up Questions I Asked:

**1. Metrics and Data Access:**
- "How do you measure success? Do you have programmatic access to how creators use tools?"
- **Blaze:** Track time to create assets in Airtable, small team so direct observation

**2. Advice for Starting:**
- "If I started today, what advice would you have?"
- **Daniel:** Don't be shy, ask everyone, find resources (EA has many AI teams)
- **Rhea:** Same but bigger scale (cross-studio, cross-teams), people willing to share
- I connected it to my SME mapping initiative at Amazon

**Tell Mehul:**
> "I asked thoughtful follow-ups. When Daniel said 'don't be shy, ask everyone,' I immediately connected it to my SME mapping workshop at Amazon. Your advice to make connections paid off—they could see I've done this before."

---

### Closing & Next Steps (Last 10 min):

**Daniel's Feedback:**
- "Pretty good and satisfied with your presentation of your background, way of thinking"
- "That's pretty much what we're looking for"

**Next Steps:**
- Tyler will contact for second panel
- **Daniel: "I think that you fit very well on what we're looking for"**
- "Probably you'll get scheduled for that second panel"
- More technical: coding (50% AI/ML, 50% general programming)
- DSA, OOP, design patterns, ML parameters, architecture

**Daniel's Guidance for Next Round:**
- Sorting optimization, OOP implementation, MVC, design patterns
- ML parameter setup
- Python sufficient (not deep C++/memory management)
- **"It's not about if you know the syntax, it's more about your general way of thinking"**
- He'll coordinate with interviewers on appropriate difficulty

**His Final Words:**
- "We appreciate your time and your clear and friendly way of explaining things"
- "Hope we see you again in not a long time"

**Tell Mehul:**
> "At the end, Daniel said THREE incredible things: 1) 'you fit very well on what we're looking for,' 2) 'pretty good and satisfied with your background and way of thinking,' and 3) 'clear and friendly way of explaining things.' That last one—YOUR advice made me clear and friendly. Not robotic, not rambling. Conversational."

## 🎨 SPECIFIC MEHUL ADVICE MOMENTS

### Moment 1: Started Rambling, Caught Myself

**What Almost Happened:**
- Started going chronological through VTO phases
- Would have taken 10+ minutes
- They didn't care about timeline

**What Actually Happened:**
- After 2 minutes of background, I asked "am I going in the right direction?"
- Daniel: "Focus on challenges and decisions you made"
- I pivoted immediately to architecture and trade-offs

**Tell Mehul:**
> "Remember when you said 'watch for cues'? I almost went chronological for 10 minutes. Caught myself, asked 'is this what you're looking for?' He wanted challenges, not timeline. I pivoted on the spot. That self-awareness came from practicing with YOU."

---

### Moment 2: Rhea's Scalability Questions (Your "Let Them Probe" Advice)

**What Could Have Happened:**
- I explain all of ORR upfront in intro
- Boring monologue
- Lose her interest

**What Actually Happened:**
- Mentioned "operational readiness review" casually
- Rhea: "Tell me more about that"
- I got to go DEEP on exactly what SHE cared about
- She said "That is a very good answer"

**Tell Mehul:**
> "If I'd info-dumped ORR in my intro, she would have glazed over. Instead, I mentioned it as a keyword. SHE asked about it. Then I got to explain all the details when SHE was engaged and listening. Your 'mention keywords, let them probe' strategy was PERFECT for this."

---

### Moment 3: Project Scott & Blaze's Documentation Pain

**What Could Have Happened:**
- Spent 5 minutes on Project Scott upfront
- They don't care
- Wasted time

**What Actually Happened:**
- Mentioned Scott as "another project, documentation assistant"
- **Blaze: "I have a lot of complaints about documentation internally"**
- NOW she's engaged
- We had great discussion about legacy data and red-teaming

**Tell Mehul:**
> "I would have spent 5 minutes explaining Project Scott if I'd gone first. But I just mentioned it. Blaze IMMEDIATELY said she has documentation problems. Your advice to let them reveal what THEY care about meant I only dove deep when they WANTED to hear it."

---

### Moment 4: Being FIFA Fan (Emotional Connection)

**What Happened:**
- Mentioned "FIFA player and fan" in intro
- Casual mention of "EA Sports. It's in the game"
- Rhea shared Battlefield 6 launching tomorrow
- Created warmth beyond technical

**Tell Mehul:**
> "The FIFA mention worked EXACTLY as you said. Not 'I studied your company,' but 'I'm genuinely a fan.' Rhea shared about Battlefield 6 launch—she wouldn't have if I was just another candidate. You helped me make an emotional connection, not just technical."

## 🙏 THANK YOU TO MEHUL

**Opening:**
> "Mehul, I seriously can't thank you enough. Your advice wasn't just 'good tips'—it was the DIFFERENCE between me sounding robotic vs conversational, between info-dumping vs letting them guide, between over-practicing vs going in fresh."

**Specific Thanks:**
> "Three specific things you did:
>
> 1. **Trigger words strategy** - I sounded natural because of this. They had no idea I had notes.
>
> 2. **'Let them probe' advice** - This was HUGE. Every interviewer got to ask about what THEY cared about. Rhea asked 3 scalability questions and I crushed them. If I'd pre-dumped everything, she wouldn't have been engaged.
>
> 3. **'Don't hyperoptimize'** - You saved me from over-practicing. I went in fresh with energy. If I'd practiced for 2 hours straight, I would have been drained and scripted."

**The Result:**
> "Daniel said at the end: 'you fit very well on what we're looking for' and 'clear and friendly way of explaining things.' That second part—that's YOUR advice. You made me clear and friendly instead of rambling or robotic."

**Bottom Line:**
> "This wasn't just a 'good interview.' Daniel explicitly said I fit well and he's recommending me for second round. They all seemed engaged. Rhea said my ORR answer was 'very good.' This went REALLY well, and your advice was a huge part of why."

**Closing:**
> "Thank you for taking time this morning to do the mock with me. Thank you for all the strategic advice. And thank you for telling me not to hyperoptimize—I would have burned out. I owe you big time. When I get this offer, drinks are on me. 🍻"
