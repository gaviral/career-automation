Hi Naomi,

Thank you for the scheduling invite – I'm excited about the next round of interviews!

I'll be submitting my availability right now. Since you're coordinating these interviews, I wanted to ask if you have any details on:

- **Interview structure:** Format (live coding vs. design discussion vs. mix)?
- **Prep focus:** Should I emphasize algorithmic depth (data structures, optimization) or architectural thinking?
- **Technical domains:** Any emphasis on specific areas (ML ops, cloud architecture)?
- **Difficulty level:** Any guidance on target level?

Thanks so much for coordinating!

Best regards,

Aviral

## Strategy:

✅ **Direct questions:**
- Same questions as Tyler
- No qualifications or "outside your scope"
- She'll either know or redirect

✅ **Efficient:**
- One email covers availability + prep
- Respects her intelligence (she'll handle it)
- Shows proactive prep mindset

✅ **Professional:**
- Clear, organized questions
- Brief and respectful
- Trusts she'll do the right thing
