# Comprehensive Follow-Up Email to Tyler

**Subject:** Quick follow-ups – thank-you notes + interview prep

Hi Tyler,

Hope you're having a good week—I know things have been busy with the Battlefield 6 launch!

I wanted to follow up on a couple of things from my earlier emails:

**1. Thank-you notes to the interviewers:**

In my previous email, I shared a thank-you message to Blaze, Daniel, and Rhea. I totally understand if you've been swamped, but whenever you get a chance—would you be able to forward that to them? If you'd prefer, you can also share their email addresses and I can send directly. No pressure at all, just wanted to check in since a bit of time has passed.

**2. Interview prep guidance:**

I'm actively preparing for the second round now. During my interview, Daniel mentioned it would cover coding skills (roughly half AI/ML, half general programming) with potential architecture questions. To prep as effectively as possible, I'd love your input on:

- **Structure:** Any sense of the format (live coding vs. design discussion vs. mix)?
- **Depth:** Should I prepare for algorithmic depth (data structures, optimization) or more architectural thinking?
- **Focus areas:** Any emphasis on specific domains (ML ops, cloud architecture, product thinking)?
- **Difficulty level:** Any guidance on target level?

I realize these might still be in flux as Daniel coordinates with the team, but any guidance would help me focus my prep time best.

Thanks so much for your patience and support throughout this process. I really appreciate it.

Best,

Aviral

## Strategy Notes:

**Tone:** 
- Appreciative (acknowledges he's busy)
- Respectful (doesn't pressure on thank-you note)
- Proactive (shows active prep)
- Specific (concrete asks help him respond)

**Framing:**
- Acknowledges multiple emails without seeming pushy
- Shows he's respecting Tyler's time
- Demonstrates genuine interest (active prep signals)
- Thank-you notes = relationship building (he'd forwarded if possible)
- Prep questions = maximizing chances (shows seriousness)

**Why this works:**
1. Opens with empathy (Battlefield 6 launch)
2. Separates two asks clearly (#1 and #2)
3. Gives him flexibility (forward OR share emails)
4. Acknowledges time has passed without guilt
5. Shows preparation mindset (increases candidacy)
6. References what Daniel said (more credible)
