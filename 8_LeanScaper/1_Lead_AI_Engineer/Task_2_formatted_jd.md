## About the Role

We are seeking a Lead AI Engineer to take charge of building the next generation of our AI platform. You will be responsible for architecting and implementing agentic workflows, owning core AI functionalities, and scaling the data infrastructure required to power them. Working within our development process (a modified version of ShapeUp), you will collaborate closely with product and leadership to turn well-defined product goals into shipped features.

The ideal candidate is a product-minded builder with a strong sense of ownership and a proven track record of shipping high-impact AI features from concept to production.

## What You'll Do

- Lead the design, development, and deployment of agentic AI workflows.
- Own critical components of our AI platform, from data pipelines and vector search to model integration and fine-tuning.
- Drive our technical AI roadmap, collaborating with product and leadership to define future capabilities and strategic direction.
- Architect and build robust, scalable data pipelines to ingest and process new data sources, enriching our AI agents' capabilities.
- Mentor other engineers and establish best practices for AI development across the company.
- Lead research into emerging AI technologies and implement strategies for refining or fine-tuning LLMs to capture landscaping industry-specific knowledge.
- Optimize LLM performance by tracking hallucinations, strengthening observability, and balancing costs.
- Enforce data quality, integrity, and security in pipelines powering AI workflows

## What You'll Bring

**Technical Expertise**: Proven experience shipping AI products with LLM orchestration (LangChain, LlamaIndex); data infrastructure (LlamaCloud); evaluation tools (LangSmith); vector databases (Pinecone, pg_vector); and LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini). Expert-level proficiency in TypeScript and Node.js.

**Technical Leadership**: Demonstrated ability to own complex technical projects, make key architectural decisions, and guide features from concept to production.

**Craftsmanship & Pragmatism**: A commitment to writing clean, maintainable code with a pragmatic approach to testing. You know when to refactor and when to ship.

**Product Mindset**: A strong focus on the end-user and a passion for building solutions that solve real-world problems.

**Cloud Fluency**: Experience deploying and managing applications and data infrastructure on cloud platforms, particularly AWS.

**Bonus**: Experience with our front-end stack (React and Next.js) is a plus, but not required.

## Benefits and Perks

**Remote First**: This is a fully remote position, open to candidates across North America.

**4-Day Work Week**: We value work-life balance and operate on a 4-day work week to give you more time for what matters.

**Professional Development**: A generous stipend for education, conferences, books, and other self-improvement resources.

**Competitive Compensation**: We offer a competitive salary and an annual, company-performance-based bonus.

**Health & Wellness**: We provide a generous monthly allowance to help cover health insurance costs.
