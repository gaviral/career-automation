## Letter

Dear Kardium Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Developer position at Kardium. With over 8 years of experience in software development and a strong background in building scalable web applications and integrating complex systems at Amazon, I am drawn to Kardium's mission of delivering breakthrough atrial fibrillation treatment through The Globe® Pulsed Field System. Your focus on regulatory approval and commercial launch resonates with my experience developing production-ready systems that serve millions of users.

Throughout my career at Amazon, I have designed and implemented internal software applications that integrate with multiple third-party systems, closely paralleling your requirements for ERP and PLM integration. I architected serverless systems processing 40TB of daily data, developed full-stack applications using Python and React, and integrated external microservices to extend functionality for business stakeholders. My experience with relational databases includes working with PostgreSQL, SQLite, and DynamoDB, while my API integration work spans Yahoo Finance, OpenAI, and various AWS services.

While my primary expertise lies in Python and TypeScript rather than .NET/C# or Java, I have demonstrated strong object-oriented design principles across all my projects and have extensive experience with web application development and front-end design. My work on automated testing frameworks, including achieving 100% test coverage in Kotlin applications at Amazon Prime Pantry, showcases my commitment to quality assurance and systematic testing approaches. I excel at learning new technologies rapidly and have successfully adapted to various frameworks and languages throughout my career.

What excites me about Kardium is the opportunity to apply my software development skills in a healthcare context where code quality and system reliability directly impact patient outcomes. The regulated medical device environment presents a meaningful challenge that builds upon my experience with high-stakes production systems at Amazon. I am particularly drawn to the collaborative culture you describe and the chance to work on manufacturing, regulatory, and quality management systems that support life-changing medical technology.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with complex system integration, web application development, and cross-functional collaboration can contribute to Kardium's continued success. While I would need to develop expertise in .NET/C# or Java, my strong foundation in software engineering principles and proven ability to rapidly master new technologies position me well for this transition. I am available for an interview at your convenience and excited about the possibility of contributing to your mission of improving patient lives.

Sincerely,  
Aviral Garg

## ⚠️ STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS - DO NOT PURSUE THIS POSITION**

**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Success Probability:** 15%  
**Recommendation:** FOCUS ON SENIOR BUILD ENGINEER POSITION INSTEAD

### Key Issues:

**FATAL GAPS:**
- **ZERO .NET/C# experience** (8+ years required)
- **ZERO Java experience** (8+ years alternative required)
- **No ERP/PLM systems experience**
- **No D365 F&O experience**

**Why This Application Would Fail:**
1. **Hard Technical Requirements:** 8+ years in specific technologies with zero experience
2. **Screening Filters:** Automated systems will eliminate based on missing keywords
3. **Interview Challenges:** Cannot demonstrate required technical competencies
4. **Credibility Risk:** Applying for positions with major skill gaps damages professional reputation

### Alternative Strategy:
**PURSUE SENIOR BUILD ENGINEER POSITION INSTEAD**
- 75% technical alignment vs. 30% for this role
- Leverages existing Python/CI/CD expertise
- Better salary potential with lower risk
- Stronger probability of success (70-80% vs. 15%)

### If Pursuing Despite Risks:
- Emphasize rapid learning ability with concrete examples
- Highlight transferable OOP and system design principles  
- Focus on system integration and database experience
- Acknowledge gaps honestly while showing commitment to bridge them
