## Core Reminders

- **People want you to do well** - they're trying to find someone, not weed people out
- **Treat it as collaboration**, not interrogation - these are future coworkers
- Technical questions can be very open-ended - they will push your boundaries
- Keep notes as bullet points only

### Handling Disagreement Framework (If Needed)
- **1-way door vs. 2-way door decisions** - Is this decision critical?
- Have meetings to get on same page
- If alignment fails: "This is too critical for us to decide alone. Let's bring in the team."
- **Balance when to bring in wider team**

## About Kardium

### Medical Condition: Atrial Fibrillation
- **What it is:** Irregular heart rhythm in the atria (top chambers of heart)
- **Problem:** Stray electrical signals cause atria to quiver instead of beat properly
- **Consequences:** Blood stagnates → risk of stroke, fatigue, low oxygen levels, heart failure

### The Solution: Catheter-Based Treatment
- **Mapping:** Identifies sources of bad electrical signals in left atrium
- **Ablation:** Electrically isolates those sources so only good signals flow through heart
- **Technology:** GLOBE Pulse Field System (catheter for mapping AND ablation)

### FDA Approval
- **Status:** Completed pivotal clinical study
- **Current Focus:** Regulatory approvals and commercial launch
- **Name:** GLOBE Pulse Field System (this is the new name)

## Why Kardium? (Answer Framework)

1. **Past:** Always interested in medical field (chose neurotech HoloLens Capstone at UBC over other projects)
2. **Present:** Gained 5 years Amazon experience in build tools, CI/CD, production at scale
3. **Bridge:** Natural next step to combine these
4. **Future:** Apply build engineering expertise to meaningful health impact
5. **Personal Connection:** 
   - Friends at company (Alisa, Mike) spoke highly of culture
   - Lot of collaboration between people
   - People striving to create best product possible for patients

**Key Message:** Not just "I need a job" - this is an organic next step combining CI/CD passion with health impact

## Salary Negotiation Strategy

### Approach
- Don't commit to exact number in HR screen
- Hiring manager, executive, and Sara negotiate salary (not panel members)

### Script
> "I'm looking for a competitive package that reflects my five plus years of experience and the strong overlap between the expectations for this job and what I bring to the table. I'm open to discussing the full compensation package—base, equity, benefits. What range does Kardium typically offer for this role?"

### Key Point
- Emphasize the **"overlap"** between your skills and their needs to justify upper range
- Kardium range: $90,000 - $140,000 CAD (base + 5% RRSP contribution)
- Reference: EA offered $120-125k CAD base + 15% bonus + ~$70k USD RSUs (3-year vest)

---

## Employment Gap Story

**Core Message:**
- Me, my manager, and their manager were all laid off in team reorganization
- Used the opportunity to:
  1. Take a break after 5 years at Amazon
  2. Spend quality time with family
  3. Explore local area more
  4. Continue learning (took ML program: EDA, neural networks, built ChatGPT clone)
  5. Be more intentional about next career move—focus on impact and alignment

**Framing:** This was a good time in my life to be more critical about which company and what cause I'm actually working towards.

## Questions to Ask

### To Sara (HR)
1. "Can you clarify exactly how the build tools team fits into the wider software environment at Kardium?" (Is it for Globe software or broader?)
2. "What growth opportunities and professional development resources does Kardium offer?"
3. "Is there a formal review process for feedback and career growth?"
4. Health benefits (if running out of questions)

### To Hiring Manager/Technical Panel
- Growth and promotion pathways
- Formal review process and how to stand out
- Professional development resources
- Time allocation for learning and skill development
- Favorite thing about working at Kardium
- Team collaboration style

**Note:** Kardium has formal review period every year - peer reviews, manager reviews, self-reviews. Similar to Amazon.

## AI Discussion Strategy (AVOID Unless Asked)

### DO NOT bring up AI proactively
- It's polarizing in medical device software
- People may see it as threat to their work
- Don't want to seem like "just another AI person"

### If Asked Directly
- "Yes, I've figured out how to use it effectively"
- "I use it cautiously - it's a tool, but I verify everything"
- "I have the base knowledge to do everything myself"
- "I've seen it generate garbage code with way too many lines"
- "I harness the power but with all necessary caution"

### Never Suggest
- AI should be used for critical medical device functions
- Focus on AI-specific learning (mention medical device regulations, AF treatment world instead)

---

## Resume Preparation

### Be Ready to Explain
- **Specific individual contributions** (not team accomplishments)
- **How metrics were calculated** (92% improvement = what baseline to what result?)
- **What went well vs. what didn't** on each project
- **What you'd do differently** given another chance

### Can Reference Notes For
- Specific numbers, metrics, calculations
- **Always announce:** "Let me check my notes" when looking at reference material

---

## Using Notes During Interviews

### What's Okay
- Have bullet points on screen or floating sticky note
- Have resume open to reference
- Have specific numbers written down
- Have questions written down (for in-person)
- Bring printed resume copy (in-person)

### How to Reference
- Explicitly say: "Let me check my notes for the exact metric"
- "Oh, let me pull up my resume to clarify which point you're asking about"
- At in-person: "These are some pieces of information I wanted to make sure you had"

### What's NOT Okay
- **No paragraphs** - will seem like reading ChatGPT responses
- Don't read word-for-word
- Gets awkward and lose train of thought
- Makes it seem like you have a script

---

## Technical Interview Strategy

### During Technical Questions
1. **Talk through your thought process constantly**
2. **Call out assumptions:** "I'll assume X is 3 and move forward. I'd normally look this up here."
3. **Acknowledge better approaches:** "I know there's a better way, but I'd need to look up the exact syntax."
4. **Ask intelligent questions** or **make intelligent assumptions** when stuck
5. **Clarify the problem** before diving in
6. **Expect them to push boundaries** to see how you handle being stuck
7. **It's okay to not know everything** - show how you'd collaborate/find answers

### Key Principle
- **Not looking for 100% correct** - looking for **problem-solving approach**
- They want to see: how you think, what questions you ask, what you do when stuck
- Some questions are designed to push you to the point where you don't have the answer

### If You Get Stuck
- Don't sit in silence
- Talk through what you're thinking
- "I'd need this information to proceed - I'd look it up here"
- Make intelligent assumptions and state them clearly
- Read the vibe - see if they'll give you hints

### Possible Format
- May ask you to code on whiteboard or in front of them
- Base questions with follow-up questions they haven't planned
- Build-related issues (hopefully, not brain teasers)

---

## Understanding the Role

### What the Team Does
- Software developers build backend (experimentation data storage, etc.)
- **Build team:** When devs push code, ensures it goes through all checks and pipeline
- Things go smoothly, very time-critical
- Build tools for Globe software (mapping and ablation system) - but **ask to clarify**
- Recent reorgs shifting teams around - good to get specific details

### Good Question to Ask
"Can you clarify exactly how your team fits into the wider software environment at Kardium?"

## Mindset for Interview

1. **People want you to do well** - they're trying to find someone, not weed people out
2. **Treat it as collaboration**, not interrogation - these are future coworkers
3. **Be curious and excited** about the role - show genuine interest
4. **Ask questions** - demonstrate you're evaluating fit too, not just taking anything
5. **Stay calm** - it's okay to pause, think, ask for clarification
6. **Within limits** - they're future coworkers, but still professional

---

## Skills to Verify/Brush Up On

- **Windows batch scripting** (listed as core skill - be ready to discuss)
- **Linux equivalent** (bash scripting - mention as counterpart)
- **Build tools, CI/CD pipelines** (core focus for role)
- **Review all resume numbers and metrics calculations**

---
