## üí™ Additional Insights from Friends

### Salary Negotiation (From Alisa & Nico)
- **Who negotiates:** Hiring manager, executive, and Sara (NOT panel members)
- **Don't commit to exact number** in HR screen
- **Emphasize "overlap"** between your skills and their needs to justify upper range
- If Sara insists: "I believe my experience highly overlaps with what you're asking for. I'd expect the salary to reflect that."

### Review Process at Kardium (From Alisa)
- **Formal review period every year** - similar to Amazon
- **Peer reviews:** You review peers, manager, and yourself
- **Manager automatically reviews you** + you select others who worked with you
- **Categories important to company** - self-review on those
- **Discussion with manager:** What went well, areas of improvement, goals for next year, career goals
- **Manager support:** Courses to take, opportunities for specific projects

### Using Notes During Interviews (From Alisa & Nico)
**What's Okay:**
- Have bullet points on screen or floating sticky note
- Have specific numbers written down for metrics
- Have questions written down
- Bring printed resume copy (in-person)

**Always announce when referencing:**
- "Let me check my notes for the exact metric..."
- "Let me pull up my resume to clarify which point you're asking about"

**What's NOT Okay:**
- **No paragraphs** - will seem like reading ChatGPT responses
- Don't read word-for-word - gets awkward and you lose train of thought

### Technical Interview Strategy (From Alisa & Nico)
**During Technical Questions:**
1. **Talk through your thought process constantly**
2. **Call out assumptions:** "I'll assume X is 3 and move forward. I'd normally look this up here."
3. **Acknowledge better approaches:** "I know there's a better way, but I'd need to look up the exact syntax."
4. **Ask intelligent questions** or **make intelligent assumptions** when stuck
5. **Clarify the problem** before diving in

**Key Principle:**
- **Not looking for 100% correct** - looking for **problem-solving approach**
- They want to see: how you think, what questions you ask, what you do when stuck
- **They will push your boundaries** to see how you handle being stuck

**If You Get Stuck:**
- Don't sit in silence - talk through what you're thinking
- "I'd need this information to proceed - I'd look it up here"
- Make intelligent assumptions and state them clearly
- Read the vibe - see if they'll give you hints

**Possible Format:**
- May ask you to code on whiteboard or in front of them
- Base questions with follow-up questions they haven't planned
- Build-related issues (hopefully, not brain teasers)

### Understanding the Role (From Alisa)
- **Software developers build backend** (experimentation data storage, etc.)
- **Build team:** When devs push code, ensures it goes through all checks and pipeline
- Very **time-critical** work
- **Build tools for Globe software** (mapping and ablation system) - but **ask to clarify**
- **Recent reorgs** shifting teams around - good to get specific details
- **Good question:** "Can you clarify exactly how your team fits into the wider software environment at Kardium?"

### AI Discussion Strategy (From Alisa & Nico)
**DO NOT bring up AI proactively:**
- It's **polarizing** in medical device software
- People may see it as threat to their work
- Don't want to seem like "just another AI person"

**If Asked Directly:**
- "Yes, I've figured out how to use it effectively"
- "I use it cautiously - it's a tool, but I verify everything"
- "I have the base knowledge to do everything myself"
- "I've seen it generate garbage code with way too many lines"
- **Always highlight your skepticism** - ensure it's giving correct information

**Never Suggest:**
- AI should be used for critical medical device functions
- Focus on AI-specific learning (mention **medical device regulations, AF treatment world** instead)

### Handling Disagreement Framework (From Notes)
- **1-way door vs. 2-way door decisions** - Is this decision critical?
- Have meetings to get on same page
- If alignment fails: "This is too critical for us to decide alone. Let's bring in the team."
- **Balance when to bring in wider team**

### Skills to Brush Up On (From Avi's Concern)
- **Windows batch scripting** (listed as core skill - be ready to discuss)
- **Linux equivalent** (bash scripting - mention as counterpart)
- Can say: "I have experience with Windows batch scripting, and also with the Linux equivalent (bash scripting)"

### Final Mindset Reminder (From Nico)
- **Everyone is very friendly** - going into interview with high hopes
- **Everyone is on your side** - not trying to test you, trying to find good fit
- **They're going to be your coworkers** - treat them that way already (within limits)
- **It's a conversation**, not an interrogation

**Remember: People want you to do well!!!**
