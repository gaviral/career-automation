Hi Sara,

Thank you so much for the reminder! I'm all set and really looking forward to our conversation in an hour.

I'm excited to discuss my background and learn more about the Senior Software Build Engineer role and Kardium's mission. I've prepared some questions as well and can't wait to connect.

See you soon!

Best regards,  
Aviral Garg
