# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE: No Take-Home Test

## Correction from Sara (HR Screen - Oct 10, 2025)

**Sara's clarification during HR screen interview:**

> "Something that I think I made a mistake in sending you an email, **there is no take home test**. I think I sent take home test. The next steps would be this HR screen, then panel interview, and a final interview. **There is no executive interview too**. That's the long version that I sent to you, but I was trying to be quick, and that's the template we‚Äî I didn't delete that part. And I sent it. I realized that."
