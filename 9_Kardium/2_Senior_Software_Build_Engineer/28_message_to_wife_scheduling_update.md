# Message to Wife - Kardium Interview Scheduling Update
## Date: October 16, 2025

---

"Kardium scheduled my technical panel for Monday Oct 20, 10-11:30 AM with 3 senior people (DevOps Lead, DevOps Expert, Tools Lead). Problem: I have another interview that day because when I said I was 'wide open early next week' on Tuesday, I didn't expect them to take 2 days to schedule it. But Kardium is the more important opportunity and I'm more likely to get selected there because of my two internal referrals (Alyssa and Mike). I'm going to confirm with Kardium immediately and move the other Monday interview to Tuesday. Can't reschedule Kardium after saying I was available - looks unprofessional and Sara already coordinated 3 busy people. Interview will be: company discussion, resume walkthrough, technical questions on DevOps + development skills, and behavioral questions. Need to prep this weekend."
