Salary Negotiation Strategy **Avi:** Looking for a situation where the salary number doesn't come out vastly different from the posted range later. That would be a waste of time for both sides. I'm happy to move forward with the range and discuss specifics later. I'll do the same thing here instead of giving a number. **Al:** I guess they have a range. **Avi:** I need to be drinking water. [Transcription note] **Avi:** The guy at EA said the range was lower than the compensation in the job description, but then I confirmed it was actually the base salary he'd given. The range in the job description was more the total compensation. **Avi:** I think I'll try to do the same. If Sara's really insistent on getting a number from me, I'll say the upper limit in that range—or maybe higher. What do you guys think? **Al:** I don't think that's going to happen, though. **Avi:** Her asking me, or me getting the upper range? **Ni:** Her insisting on a number. If you say you're okay to move forward with the range, you'll have the specific number as you learn more about the job during the interviews. That'll be okay. I've never been on that side of talent acquisition. Usually the hiring manager deals with HR and the candidate to work out salary. The rest of the panel doesn't get involved in salary negotiation. **Al:** The hiring manager, the executive who's involved, the talent person, and the candidate do the salary negotiation. The rest of the panel isn't in that part. **Ni:** If you're talking about the upper limit, you could say you believe your experience highly overlaps with what they're asking for. You would expect the salary range to reflect that. **Al:** You're not committing to the upper bound, but you're implying the overlap means higher bound. **Ni:** I don't think they're going to have a number for you right at the beginning. We're both happy with something in the range. We're going to be close on a number here. You're not going to say $250,000 when the range is posted at whatever it was. **Ni:** As far as I'm aware, she's not going to be able to give you an exact number right before talking. I would be very surprised if she needed to get an exact number out of you during this first call. **Avi:** There was one recruiter who insisted on it five or six times, but that only happened once with me. **Ni:** I don't think it's worth getting to an exact number at this point because they haven't interviewed you yet. As long as we know we're kind of on the same page and we're not wildly apart, we can move forward with it. **Avi:** I had AI generate this question for EA, and I found the document. I said exactly this: "I'm looking for a competitive package that reflects my five plus years of experience building cloud native ML applications at Amazon. I'm open to discussing the full compensation package—base, equity, benefits. What range does EA typically offer for this role?" **Avi:** I feel the overlap thing you're saying, maybe I can explicitly mention. I think there's a great overlap with Kardium. I'm looking for a competitive package that reflects the five plus years experience and the big overlap in the expectations for this job and what I bring to the table. Something along those lines. **Al:** That's so good. **Ni:** Sweet. --- ### 2. Company Knowledge Preparation **Al:** Before I forget, you should be prepared for Sara or anyone on the panel interview to ask, "What do you know about Kardium?" You don't have to know the whole company, but they want to know that you loosely know what atrial fibrillation is, you have an idea of what they do, you know about the catheter. It's not just "You're one of 20 companies I interviewed. Who are you again?" **Avi:** You don't need to know all of that S-node stuff. **Al:** No, I was saying you know we make a catheter for atrial fibrillation. You have a general idea of what atrial fibrillation is. **Avi:** Something wrong with the heart. That's all I know, but I'll look it up more. **Al:** Irregular heart rhythm, based in the atria. The top part. **Avi:** Four chambers of the heart. Left and right atrium and left and right ventricle? **Al:** Basically a stray electrical signal is traveling in your heart that makes it fluctuate incorrectly. The heart is quivering. The atria is quivering instead of doing a nice full beat, so your blood can stagnate in the atria. That can lead to strokes because the blood is not moving around as it should. Stagnant blood leads to strokes, and there can be other side effects because the blood's not flowing through your body—fatigue, low oxygen levels, things like that. **Avi:** And you guys are using the catheter to do some ablation in certain parts? **Al:** There are certain areas of the left atrium which create these bad signals. We electrically isolate those sources from the rest so that only the good signal flows through the heart, and these bad signals don't come in and mess up the electrical signals that should be going through the heart. **Avi:** So the catheter is to map (how you find the source areas) and then also ablate. You ablate to electrically isolate the source signals. **Al:** That's more than enough to know. You already know we got our FDA approval. **Al:** For the job you're applying for, that's a lot of information you have there. **Avi:** Maybe have the exact name of what the FDA approval was. I put that in my cover letter. Should at least know that. **Al:** Both the mapping and ablation system. They post on LinkedIn. You can Google it. There's news. **Avi:** I almost wonder if I wrote the wrong thing because I wrote "the recent success of your pivotal clinical study for GLOBE Pulse field system is a landmark achievement." Is that right? **Al:** That's the new name. We changed the name. I forgot. **Avi:** Look at me, I'm ready to go. It's like I've been following this company for a long time. Sorry, I'm still stuck with the old things. **Al:** I still remember Al talking about it. She always calls it that. --- ### 3. Why Kardium? Crafting the Answer **Avi:** Thing I was thinking about is why Kardium? Not just knowing about it. I need to find the actual, genuine reason why I'm interested in Kardium. Not just "I need a job right now. Someone give me a job." **Al:** That is also true. **Avi:** I tried to look quite a bit into health care. Even the project I did was because with AI coming in, seeing how things are getting automated, I'm able to achieve a lot more. I've learned how to scale things at Amazon. I learned how to operate at scale, develop apps, and productionize things so that millions of people are being served with whatever products I'm building. Having learned all that, felt like now I wanted to go closer to what I always wanted to do. Maybe I can bring in how for my Capstone, I was approved for multiple different projects, but I went for the neurotech HoloLens project I worked on—health care—because I can make a big impact. Of course, I need to figure out better ways to say this, but try to use the past and say "this is the organic next step" because now I'm more in a position to select where I want to go compared to just taking anything. I've gotten the training. Now it feels like the right step to go in and make the impact in health. **Ni:** You want to apply all of that training to something that you think is going to make an impact to people. **Al:** What you're saying is very generic still. For this job in particular, it would be good to focus on: you've always been interested in the medical field. So far, your path has taken you to Amazon. You gained all of this experience with the build tools in production at scale. That's the main thing you want to link to the build tools things for this build engineer role. Now you see this opportunity where you can come back to the medical field and use all of those skills to make a bigger impact or an impact that you care about more. **Avi:** Impact closer to... impacting people's lives in a more meaningful way. Combining my interest for CI/CD, the tools. **Al:** Then it wouldn't hurt at that point if it comes up or hasn't to throw in, "I know a few people who work at Kardium." You can throw my name in there. You can throw Mi's name in there. They really talk it up. Company culture is really good. **Ni:** You've heard it's a really good place to work because of these specific people. Company culture is really good. **Al:** Have a few key points about what's actually good. Lot of collaboration between people. People are striving to create the best product possible for our patients. We're trying to create something great for people here. **Avi:** The culture sounds like people are thinking about the things that you said. Even the overlap we talked about before—the documentation people need that kind of thing. So even if they don't have it right now, that's a good thing because I can come in to fill that gap if that is an issue. **Al:** I wouldn't say it that way. I wouldn't mention that as an issue. **Avi:** More like everyone wants that, and this is something I've had these projects in. Maybe I won't bring this up during this particular question. I'll have to find a different place to bring in documentation. I'll have two or three points about these things I need to convey to her if smoothly possible, organically. **Ni:** I don't know how much pressure should be on you to convey it because anything that's important, she's going to ask you directly. I don't think you have to be in the back of your mind, "Oh, I have to mention this now" because that could make it more difficult for you. **Avi:** Maybe during the open-ended part towards the end. If these things weren't covered, I'll have my list in front of me. These are the four main things I must convey to them. Three of them were already covered. When she asks if I have any questions for her, maybe as an extra note: "I also wanted to say this is one thing I'm really good at—X, Y, Z." Have a question ready for them, at least two of them. --- ### 4. Questions to Ask **Al:** You should have a few questions ready for each person. Depending what the type of question is, for the panel interview, the technical panel interviews—if it's a general question ("What's your favorite thing about working at Kardium?" or "What do you like about your job?"), it's fine to ask both technical groups that same question. If it's a general question that makes sense you want the answer from a lot of different people, go ahead and ask that to multiple people. I don't think that's a problem. **Avi:** There was one question. I don't remember the good wording, but something along the lines of: "Can you tell me if there's a formal evaluation criteria, like a yearly performance review kind of thing? Just to get an idea of how frequently and how exactly we get feedback on if you're on the right path so that, you know, just in order to be an asset to the company and contribute to the team, I'm wondering what the process is. And can you give me an example (if it's a manager) of how someone used that criteria to stand out, not just meet the bar, but even stand out?" **Ni:** For me, as you're saying this, it's giving me vibes of where you're more concerned about you being concerned about being on the wrong track. The question should be more about promotions or moving up. "Is there opportunity to really grow at Kardium?" **Avi:** I was thinking about that, but then trying to maybe not say it explicitly about promotion. **Al:** I think "to grow" is better. "Do you sort of have or is there any type of formal review that helps make sure that we're on the correct path for growth?" Something like that maybe. Growth could be the keyword there. **Al:** You could maybe ask about learning opportunities. "Do you have opportunities to learn things on the job or expand your skill set? Does Kardium help their employees keep up with the latest and greatest information that's coming out there?" Professional development, maybe. **Ni:** At your other companies, maybe you had some resources for that. Does Kardium have any resources for that? **Avi:** Which would be part of benefits, basically. **Al:** You could also ask questions about more of the benefits stuff. I know some of it was posted in the job ads, so make sure you don't ask if they have this if they already mentioned they have it. **Avi:** I think the benefits specifically, I might ask Sara about that—the health benefits and all of that stuff. She'll have the most information about that. But growth, review process for growth, professional development I would try and ask that when you're in the interview with whoever the hiring manager is. **Al:** You could also ask Sara if you're running out of questions. I just wouldn't ask your hiring manager what the health benefits are because they're not going to remember. **Avi:** I don't think I was going to ask about the health benefits anyway because I think I'm already covered with Am. If anything, don't give me any benefits. Give me the pay—increase the base pay instead. Obviously, that's not how it works. **Ni:** You're just taking our benefits package. **Avi:** You can ask about this development stuff to Sara. Like in your growth, the growth opportunities and what kind of feedback you can expect from people on an ongoing basis or more formal feedbacks if that's something that's built into the system. **Al:** I can tell you what it is, but it's good to have these questions where she can answer in a positive way. You're kind of setting her up for success. I can tell you what happens now. It's not a secret if you want me to tell you what we do. **Avi:** I think you should tell me, but I'll still ask. Because when I ask her, it could be more like a follow-up. She would probably give the same answer as what you would give right now. But then I'll have a follow-up question prepared for maybe some nuance in there that might actually be worth asking. Asterisk there. **Al:** It depends what level of detail she goes into. I don't know exactly what she would tell you, but it's not a secret process or anything. We have a formal review period every year. It involves your peers reviewing you and you reviewing your manager, and you review other peers. Your manager automatically reviews you, and then you also select a few people that you think you worked with during the year and that you think would be good people to review you. They try and balance it out—not one person arguing 20 people or whatever, but they parse it out like that. Then there are different categories that are important to the company, and you review yourself on those categories as well. That was almost same as Amazon. **Ni:** It's a pretty standard way of doing things. **Al:** If you have a formal process, I think this is pretty standard way of doing it. Then those reviews get collated together, and then you go through everything with your manager one at a time, discussing: "These are the things everyone thought was good, I thought was good, you thought were good. These are areas of improvement. Like, what do you think we can do?" Goals for the next year, career goals. Talk about, you know, with the manager: is there anything the manager needs to do to help you do that? Are there courses you should be looking at, or is it opportunities during the year you should be taking for specific projects? **Avi:** One thing we did was sometimes we would set up time for personal growth and development or even writing the promotion documents. We had to write our own documents—or at least work experience summaries—so that the manager could write the promotion document for you. So in our stand-up or at least the sprint planning, we would actually take some time. Like, out of the two weeks, I'll take half a day or one quarter of a day in the two upcoming weeks to work on that or some time for learning, taking a different course. I was wondering if I should ask if you guys have something similar. Not in those gory details, but more like: do you guys have allotment for time or some resources where people can learn about all the ever-changing AI world? Or just not even bring AI—just in general. **Al:** I think maybe don't say AI specifically because it could be atrial fibrillation treatment world things that we need to know or medical device regulations. There's a lot of different things that you might need to be learning about that's not just AI specific. So I wouldn't get too focused on the AI. I don't even plan on bringing that up unless they want to hear more about that project. Then go forward. **Avi:** There's a lot of other things that people—it depends on the job—but there are a lot of other things that are specific to the AF world and the medical device world that you need to learn about that's not AI. So you don't want to seem like you're just focused on learning that stuff. --- ### 5. AI Discussion Strategy (Use Caution) **Avi:** I don't see it yet, but if it really feels like this would be useful, I don't want to force AI talk in here at all. If it's something like, "Hey, it could be useful or something for this senior build engineer position" if there's something mentioned that's close to it, maybe a mention, if at all. **Al:** It's polarizing as well. I don't know what the opinions are of all of the software engineers that are there. So you don't want to show which side you're on because I don't know which side they're on. I think people use it for some information, but some of them are a lot more old school. I don't know if that means they're going to be really against it. They might not say that's why they don't want to hire you, but they're like, "Oh, this is another AI person." **Ni:** I would stay away from that. I would say that's probably the vibe for any of these jobs that are not hiring you for a specific AI role. **Al:** You're going to have people there who don't like AI because it's sort of a threat to their work or they feel like there's so much more competition now because all these people are doing AI. So they have a mental radar where they're trying to weed out all of the people who just vibe coding or whatever. You don't want to give off any of those things. I would lean towards being cautious. **Ni:** But you've been through all of this. You went to school for this. You've been through the wringer of doing all of this pre-AI. That's the expertise that you're bringing. And then if they ask, "Can you use it as well?" Be like, "Yes, I figured out how to use it. I've done all of that. I have all of the base knowledge. I can do it myself as well." But only if asked. **Avi:** That's what I'm thinking because I don't think... You just don't know. You don't want to bias a specific panel member and then they have some sway. And they're going, "Oh, well, I don't think so." I'm thinking to add to this: in this world as well, the medical world, I would say you still need to lean towards the fact that it's really dangerous for all of these people to start using AI. **Al:** Maybe in your head, you think, "Yeah, eventually AI can help a lot," but I would not disclose that. Or you could mention you believe that, but it's currently not at the state—or I could be literally thinking in a way where it's in a very small component to automate certain things that are completely safe. Rather, if anything, it's making things more safe. **Ni:** But they may not share that opinion. So AI can be very difficult to traverse. I'll just stay away from it unless they specifically ask, and I really like what you said. **Avi:** I've figured it out. I know how to use it. I'd rather say it in a good way that I've learned the ins and outs of it. I've understood it. But I use it cautiously. But I use the full power of it, but with all the caution needed. **Al:** I think that's good to make sure. Also what you're saying, though, if somebody brings it up, you'll talk about it. I think whenever you talk about it, with here at least, you should always highlight your own skepticism about it. It's a tool that I know is available to me, but I know that I need to ensure it is giving me the correct information. I can't just believe it a 100% of the time. I mean, you'll also have your own stories about or your own experience. You can see how all of the code just grows massively, and there's a lot of stupid stuff in there. You've seen it. **Avi:** Garbage code. Add way more lines than what's needed for something. **Al:** You've seen it be out of control, I guess. Also, if they start asking you about it, you don't want to put it down a 100%. You do like using it. There are good things. So you don't want to be one of those people who's like, "No, AI is garbage. Here's all the bad things about AI." **Ni:** Now know there are good things. Like, here are the good things that I've learned how to use. Obviously, I have to be very careful with it. I have all this base knowledge. This is how I use it to my advantage. **Avi:** Harness the power of it if asked. Because you don't want to be too far off of they're never going to use AI for anything. Like, we eventually will. **Ni:** Figure out some better ways to communicate that, but those are good points to have. --- ### 6. Understanding the Role and Team **Avi:** Maybe one thing I remember when we were working on the resume: we said we'll talk about going through the job description itself. If you were going through my resume for this particular job, what would your opinion be or what kind of question would you ask if you were in Sara's shoes? **Al:** For Sara in particular, it's hard to know. I think she's going to be given very specific criteria from the hiring manager. "This is the kind of person we need to know. They need to have these specific skills." I think we've already talked about it. I'm sure they have some kind of checklist. "They need to know this language. They need to have this." **Al:** I feel like we went through often. Was there anything on the ad that you didn't have that you think they need? **Avi:** And also, what my question was also around: is there something that it would be good to relearn? Because I know you gave me a lot of information earlier, but what this team does—I'll tell you maybe what I remember and maybe that could help. My understanding was that software developers build different things about that backend where you're storing all the experimentation data and all that. But this team, essentially, when the software developer software team is finished building their stuff, they're pushing their code—the build, making sure that is going through all the checks and the pipeline around it. Things are going smoothly, and it's very time critical. That's my understanding of what they do. **Al:** I think that's a good question to ask. "Can you clarify exactly how your team fits into the wider software environment at Kardium or something like that?" I think that would be a definitely a good question to ask. Because that's my general understanding of what they do. But they've also been doing a lot of reorgs, shifting the teams around. So that would be a very good question to just ask them to get the specific details. That's my general gist of what's going on. **Avi:** These are the build tools for the mapping software and stuff? That's my understanding. **Al:** It's not clear in the post if that's what it's for. I think it says that. It says the Globe software in there. Based on the hiring manager, I'm pretty sure that's what it is, but I don't know. You don't want to be build engineer for all the internal tools or something. **Al:** I think that's a very good question to ask them to get the specific details. Maybe I could ask Sara if she knows more about it because the hiring manager would have given her some details, what we're looking for. Maybe, maybe not. I don't think it hurts to ask her. And if she doesn't have the information, she'll just be like, "You know, that's a great question to talk to the hiring manager about." **Ni:** I think in general, you want to come across as curious and excited about this job. You want to know more. You're not just... That's what your attitude shouldn't be like. You don't also want to overload her with a bunch of questions. But just as long as you're confident that you've shown her that you are really interested and curious about learning more about the job and moving forward, I think. **Avi:** Because I think it's important that you also know what you're getting into and it's a good fit as well. And I think they are going to appreciate that you're trying to make sure that this is a good job for you. You're not just trying to take anything. --- ### 7. Employment Gap Story **Al:** On the same note, you have your story straight for the gap between now and Amazon? **Avi:** I'm going with what you said. What we had discussed. I actually had it prepared, written it down somewhere. Me, my manager, and their manager, they're all laid off. There was a team reorganization. I used that as an opportunity to take a break. All five years at Amazon, I've gained a lot of experience. Now it was a good time for me to take a break, step back, spend some quality time with my family, even explore the area where I'm living in, which I haven't done as much. And then I also used that time while I was relaxing to learn. I'm just generally curious and I love to learn. So during that time, I took this machine learning program where I learned about EDA, neural networks, from the ground up. Even learned how to build my own chatbot. I built my own ChatGPT—a baby version, obviously. But it was responding to what I was saying, with the right things. And it was a great learning experience with that. Now I felt like it's time to be back in the market—I'll use a better word for market—but for the job market. I guess it could be also a good place if I haven't already mentioned the health thing. Because I've had the passion for CI/CD tools and maintaining whatever software, making it is maintained well and have the right tools and things are automated. I think there was automation they wanted in this. So I felt like... You could even say something like you've been looking for opportunities where you can really add value now and the medical field. Kind of use: you took all of this time off, and you felt like this was a good time in your life to be more critical about which company, what cause, whatever you're actually working towards. **Ni:** I like that because I think even in a way I will be... hopefully all the other interviews go well, and then I can actually, this may actually be the case where I am looking at, "Hey, I have these two or three options," fingers crossed, and I'll be selecting where I want to spend my time. Because I do want to make an impact. **Al:** I think that's good. --- ### 8. Resume Deep Dive Preparation **Ni:** That all sounds good to me. I'm just thinking about your resume in general. I would be ready to answer questions about what very specific roles you had in any of the projects that you have listed there. They want to make sure that you are not just, "Oh, well, my team did this. I was just kind of on the edge. I didn't do anything, but this is what our team accomplished." What specific things are pieces of that did you do? What did you contribute to it? **Avi:** I actually got caught in a bad situation in this thing where in one interview, I had written down what my team had done along with what I did in there. So after that, I just never put in what my team did. Everything in the resume, I've made sure it's something that I did and that I can talk about. So I think there's that. And I do need to go through my resume entirely to make sure all the numbers that I have, like the "why is 92% improvement," what did I really calculate? Was it things went from just three to four or versus things going from 40 billion to 50 billion or whatever. How is it measured? I've did write some things about it, but I do need to polish it. **Al:** I think that would definitely be good to have. Specifics about the projects that we put in there. Any numbers that you have in there, something to back it up. They don't know the details of it, but this is how I calculated it or this is the metric that we were using. **Ni:** They might ask details about, "Okay, what went well on this project? What didn't go well? What would you want to do differently if you had the chance?" **Avi:** That's all I'm seeing. At least in terms of what my next steps are, I just wanted to run it by you guys as well. --- ### 9. Using Notes During Interviews **Al:** I think it's okay to have some notes with you. You can definitely have your resume there to reference. That's not a problem. I think I personally—tell me if you think this is wrong—I think it would be fine to have notes there if you have specific numbers. Like you said this number here, 95% increase. "How did you measure that?" Be like, "If you remember off the top of your head, that's great." And then you'd be like, "Oh yeah, I wrote that down. So we were measuring it this way. We went from this number to this number." I would explicitly say, "Oh, I wrote that down. Let me just look at this. This is what we did." If you're going to be looking at the notes, I would just make a mention of that. "One second. I've got my notes here. This is how we measured it." If it's to remind you of any stories you want to tell or points or things, I would just have on the screen where you would be looking or if you do have a spot, I would put some bullet points there. Maybe a floating sticky note. **Al:** She is going to have one in person interview at least. But I don't know, maybe you don't even need it. Maybe just look, have bullet points and look at them right before the interview or something. **Ni:** But definitely don't have any paragraphs. Don't read off. There's no—it'll make it seem like, "Oh, I'm just typing that question into ChatGPT. Here is what they are saying to me." But if it was specific numbers from your past that you're pulling up to help confirm what you put in there, I think that's perfectly fine to say, "Yeah. Let me check what I wrote down. It was this number. This is what we were using to calculate that." **Avi:** If they ask something and you don't remember it on your resume or you're not a 100% sure if they're talking about a particular point, you can even be like, "Oh, let me quickly pull up my resume. Okay. So you're talking about this or that." **Ni:** I think any time, as Al was saying, you just make it clear what you're looking at. When you're looking at something, and you can pull up whatever you need. I think that's perfectly fair. Because they might even ask, "Okay. We're going to go through your resume now." It's like, "Okay. Let me pull that up, and have it there." **Al:** And then, obviously, when you're in person, I would definitely bring a printed out copy of the resume. "Let me look at this." Even notes, maybe bullet point notes. I think if you have it, and then you get the vibe of what's going on. You could just say, "Oh, these are some pieces of information I wanted to make sure you had by the end of the interview." Important notes for myself. You can even, I think, write down the questions that you want to ask them and having those at the in-person interview, definitely not a problem. "Okay. I think I asked all the questions. Let me just check. I have them written down. Yeah. I asked you all of these. That's great." **Avi:** Even the bullet points, I would want to ask for questions. Look back at them and say, "Oh, you had these questions," but I would have the bullet points there. So you're not reading the question. **Ni:** It would be fine to check, "Okay, I have this question." Look back at them. Ask the question. "Be like, okay. And I have this," and you can keep looking back at the bullet points. **Al:** I think that anything like that is fine. But as Ni said, I think it's important to just have bullet points if you don't want sentences written that you are obviously reading. Because that is... It's too—you get lost so easily anyway if you do that. **Avi:** Exactly. I actually tried reading from my notes before, and even though they were bullet points, they were kind of paragraphs. I actually lost train of thought because I was trying to find certain points from this and from the other thing and trying to merge the two. The dynamics of it just makes no sense. **Ni:** And then it's really awkward, and they're going, "Why is he reading something?" Even if they're not thinking about if the other person is cheating or not, that kind of stuff—first of all, that is the first biggest thing because that's what I felt I was interviewing other people at Amazon. They were actually even typing something, so that was weird. But even if... the next issue would be that it's just awkward. You know, right now, we're trying... You need to be aware of just the environment. We are having a conversation. Just don't make it awkward by just reading it off. Something and things are going in random tangents because just because you had written it down in a certain specific way. "This is what I'm going to say right now." **Al:** "I have a script. We are going to get through it. I'll get to it." --- ### 10. Technical Interview Preparation **Al:** That other thing for the technical interviews, I would be prepared to do some coding in front of them. I don't know how the software team does it. When I had my interviews, these were for co-op. It was not supposed to be a software job. They were asking me to code on a whiteboard, and I was having to write things out. I don't know if the software team does that, like hand coding during the interview. I would just be like, don't be shocked if they do ask you to do that. **Avi:** I actually have more experience with that than coding on the computer. So, I'm pretty decent. It could be either way. **Al:** And I would also, when you're doing any of the technical questions, kind of talk through your thought process. Just make sure you're telling them, "Okay. I think this is the best way to do that. I'm going to do this." Or if you even if there's a point where you're like, "You know what? I know there's a better way to do this, but I would look it up in this way." Or "I can't remember the specific function" or "You know?" Call out when you know that there's something that you're missing here, but it's like, "I this is where I would look this up. I have this information. I just don't know the exact details." Because they want to see your thinking process, how you're thinking when you're actually sitting next to them in a chair. What kind of questions are you going to ask me or what—when you get stuck, what are you going to do? **Avi:** So it's like, "Exactly." I know that, yeah. I think Ni gave a good example earlier today. Just have like, "Let's assume that the value for this thing is three, and let's move forward with that. But I would look it up first in this particular reference or just Google search." **Ni:** So maybe assuming that I'll move forward with the approach or, as you said, there's a better approach—not just a concrete answer, but I would do that. But before that, I'd need this, this, this. I'll look those things up and then make some assumptions and then move forward with that. **Al:** Great. Don't get stuck just because you don't know the perfect response to this. Definitely just talk your way through it and show that, "You know what? I know that there's a different way of doing this. I'd want to look for this information or..." You're not just blindly going into something with no thought of the better or best way to do this. You're like, "I know there are different ways of doing it. I might take a minute to just check which way I want to do this and go forward from there." **Al:** Again, I had three software questions all about MATLAB. So I'm not the best source of information on this, but that's definitely the things that in general they're looking for, definitely problem solving. When you're in that kind of situation. I'll have to think of build related issues. **Avi:** I hope they're related to that because, you give a brain teaser. As much as I enjoy them, I don't know if I'll be able to do them on time. **Ni:** Anything where you feel stuck or whatever, just take your time and just talk it through. **Al:** Talk through it. I feel like that—the worst thing is when you're sitting there in silence and the person's just thinking and you're like, "Tell us what you're thinking about." Because there also, I don't think they're always looking for a 100% correct. There are some questions where it's just, "Okay. You should know what object-oriented programming is." You know? There's some base level questions where it's okay. If they don't get this, that's the problem, but then there's some more open-ended ones where it's like, "Okay. Let's see how far we go." And you know how a lot of the interviews are, they have a base question, and then, "Okay. They answer in this way," and then people might just have follow-up questions that they haven't planned. So they don't know how you're going to answer. They don't know what the best answer is. They're just, "Oh, that's an interesting way of doing that. Why did you do this? Or have you thought about going this way? Oh, you're stuck here. Why are you stuck here? What kind of information would you need to keep going?" The technical stuff can start very open-ended, so it could just be... **Ni:** I feel like they might also—I feel like they do this at least for mine or something. They might push your boundaries just to see what you do when you get stuck. Maybe at some point expect to not have the answer. **Al:** And it's like, I think it's also okay to say, "Oh, you don't know." It's like, make sure you don't just give up. Don't give up on every question, but only... "I would... I'm not going to pretend." **Ni:** I think this team or something is kind of highlighting, "Okay. You'd probably be stuck at this point. This is how you would collaborate." **Avi:** I'm really hoping to get some more interviews before Kardium because I know the chances might be higher with Kardium. And because I do not do well in interviews in general. Like, yeah. **Ni:** I know it's way easier said than done, but you just got to just be yourself and just be confident in it. No one—going into it—people want you to do well. Because they want to find someone good. So they are rooting for you to have the answers. Because they're going to be like, "This is great if you can do all of this." If you're doing well, they're going to be happy because they're trying to find someone. **Avi:** Exactly. So everyone is in there hoping you do amazing. --- ### 11. Interview as Collaboration **Avi:** Almost even maybe see it as a collaboration thing because I think that's what at least from my side, when I used to interview people, it was like, "I want to see what kind of person would be sitting next to me on that seat." And like, let's help kind of collaboratively get to the right answer or not even that, but more so just kind of treat it as a collaborative environment. And if I have to ask them something, of course, ask intelligent questions. **Ni:** Yes. Or make intelligent assumptions that, "Hey. I don't know this. This—is it okay if I assume this?" Or may—I'll kind of read the vibe if they're actually answering. "Oh, wait. I can look this up for you" or "Here's—yeah. Assume it's this." If they're not saying anything, then I'll think I'll go with the intelligent assumption. **Al:** It's hard for me to say which way they're going to go because I've never been involved like a pure software interview, so I don't know how they set it up. When we're doing interviews for my stuff, I would as long as the answer is not staring at you right there, then I definitely encourage the questions. So I guess, you know, we have a lot of verbal questions that we put together. So if someone asked me, "Can you just repeat those numbers or something like that," yeah, that's great. But if I'm going, "This is a this is an apparatus to test the tensile strength of"—because it's more mechanical stuff, tensile strength of this string, and someone asked me, "Tensile strength?" I'm going to be like, "Yeah. A 100%." You know? So it's like, yeah. Definitely ask the questions, but make sure you're calm. You've heard what they've said. You've taken all the information in that they've given you and be like, "Okay. This is what we have. I think I need more info from you because of X, Y, Z." **Avi:** I have been in one of those situations where I did have to ask a basic question, but I was like, "Yeah, this is something I just remember missing during—or..." But from the word itself, I feel like this is what it does. When they asked me about that, I forgot the question actually. But, yeah, from the word itself, I tried to extrapolate. "I'm assuming it's something along this and the context around it is this. So with that in mind, I'm just thinking out loud. I believe it would be something along the lines of X, Y, Z and all that." And then they would kind of help me in between, and then I would move forward. But yeah. It is what it is kind of situation when that happens. **Ni:** That's for sure. If you don't know, you just don't know. I'm just more saying just make sure you've taken in the information that has been given. And don't just barrel into it without understanding what has been asked of you and make sure you comprehend what they have given you with this. **Avi:** That's fair. And I think asking for a clarification is no problem or just even when you're starting, just a quick, "Okay. You know, it obviously depends how what kind of questions you're being given and stuff, but okay. I think this is what you're after. So this is the path that I'm going to be going down." Kind of thing. If it's complicated enough that it makes sense for you to clarify at the beginning. I guess you got to also gauge, read the room a little bit. You don't want to be over-clarifying every single little thing. They might ask you a bunch of basic questions to start with. Maybe. I don't know. Just to, you know, make sure we're on the same level. "You have coded before. Like, we're there." But it is a senior position, so they might not even do that kind of stuff. There's a level of understanding that they would expect you to have based on your background. **Avi:** One thing I did notice in my resume, I ended up writing one of the things that I did not like, even after all that careful review, I wrote Windows batch scripting as one of the skills. And the automated Windows deployment, Chocolatey. I've dabbled with that once or twice. And I just—I don't know what went in my head when I was doing this. Now I'm like, I don't know if I should have put that in there. I guess I could just read more about it. **Al:** It was a core skill at the time. It was... Well, it's there now. I would definitely look up some stuff about it then. **Avi:** Shouldn't have written "core" there. Well, I mean, there's a counterpart to it in Linux, maybe I could say that I have done that as a core thing and yeah. Although I should have mentioned that. But okay. **Ni:** No. Just sorry. I just digressed. But to your point, yeah, I will ingest what they're saying even when I'm stuck. --- ### 12. Final Mindset Reminder **Ni:** But everyone is very friendly. People are going into these interviews with high hopes as well. So it's like, everyone is on your side in the interview. So it's good to go in as you're saying, it's a collaborative environment. And look, try not to see it as some test or something like that. **Avi:** I have to write that down. That's a big thing. People want you to do well. **Ni:** Yes. And they're going to put you in situations just to kind of figure out what you're like. Because I think there's—they're not trying to test you necessarily or whatever. They are going to put you in situations or things to just see how you react and learn more about you when it's basically just like, "These are going to be your coworkers or whatever." Kind of treat them like that already in a way. You know? Like, within limit. **Avi:** Within limit. Yeah. Is great advice. I think that will help me a lot because I like, even though I say that, "Yeah, it's a collaborative environment and all that." From the interviewer's perspective, when I'm in the zone, I'll have to remind myself again and again. Maybe I'll record myself, do a mock interview. And just try and see that I do tend to get a lot nervous. So maybe I'll have something written down on a piece of paper. "They want you to do well, and we are collaborating." **Al:** No. This was super duper helpful. Thank you so much. I know I've taken a lot of your time, but we're happy you got so many interviews and things. Like, things are happening, which is exciting. **Avi:** They are. They're suddenly, just one day was, "Alright. Two, three," and then I'm like, "Four." I think I have total of four right now or five. I don't know. But let's see. Anyway, they're all just screening recruiter screening so far. So... **Al:** That's still very cool. --- ## Key Insights and Action Items ### Compensation Strategy - **Approach:** Don't commit to exact number in HR screen - **Script:** "I'm looking for a competitive package that reflects my five plus years of experience and the strong overlap between the expectations for this job and what I bring to the table.
