**Subject: Application for Senior Software Build Engineer (Req #353)**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Senior Software Build Engineer position at Kardium. Having followed Kardium’s pioneering work, I am deeply impressed by your mission to deliver the best treatment for atrial fibrillation. The recent FDA approval of the Globe® Pulsed Field System is a landmark achievement, and the opportunity to contribute to the reliability and efficiency of the software behind such a life-changing medical device would be incredibly meaningful.

My background in designing, automating, and managing robust software development lifecycles aligns directly with the responsibilities of this role. As the job description emphasizes proficiency in **Python** for maintaining the CI/CD build chain and **Kotlin** for development, I am confident in my ability to make an immediate impact.

*   My expertise in **Python** is extensive. I have developed numerous automation scripts and complex applications, including a tool at T4G that automated the extraction of 10 years of version history from 15 legacy applications, **saving 7 developer hours every week**. This experience in creating custom tooling is directly applicable to writing and maintaining the programs that generate your CI/CD build chain.
*   At Amazon, I architected and maintained large-scale, **automated CI/CD pipelines** using AWS CDK, saving over 12 developer-hours weekly. I also architected robust **Kotlin** applications for the Prime Pantry API, achieving **100% test coverage** to ensure maximum reliability for a service generating millions in revenue.

I am particularly passionate about building tools that empower engineering teams and improve developer velocity. At Amazon Beauty Tech, I noticed a recurring challenge with knowledge sharing and documentation. To solve this, I independently developed "Scout," an **innovative, local-only Python-based AI agent**. By creating an intelligent system that could **instantly answer developer questions**, **automatically identify gaps in documentation**, and **integrate with our ticketing system**, this tool achieved an **82% improvement in question resolution time** and projected **240+ developer-hours monthly savings**. This experience of proactively identifying a bottleneck, building an effective software tool, and meticulously documenting its value speaks directly to the core of this role at Kardium, especially regarding maintaining CI/CD documentation and providing support to development teams.

Furthermore, I have direct experience managing and optimizing build systems. During my internship at T4G, I designed and implemented **CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps**, focusing on ensuring reliable and secure build and deployment processes. This, combined with my experience **automating developer onboarding** - where I reduced environment setup time by 75% and **saved 3,528 developer-hours annually** - demonstrates my commitment to creating the most efficient and error-free development lifecycle possible.

While I have not worked in a medical device company, my experience at Amazon has instilled a deep appreciation for the rigor required in high-stakes environments. Championing the adoption of tools like CodeGuru Profiler across 7 projects to reduce on-call incidents, optimizing APIs to prevent financial loss, and building systems that process 40TB of data daily have all required an uncompromising focus on **reliability, security, and quality** - principles I know are paramount in a **regulated setting**.

The opportunity to apply my skills in automation, CI/CD, and developer tool creation to help commercialize the Globe® System is a compelling prospect. I am eager to contribute to the efficiency of your development and test teams as you enter this exciting new phase.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my qualifications further.

Sincerely,

Aviral Garg
