## Letter

Dear Kardium Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Build Engineer position at Kardium. With over 5 years of experience architecting CI/CD systems and developing Python/Kotlin applications at Amazon, I am excited to contribute to Kardium's mission of delivering breakthrough atrial fibrillation treatment through The Globe® Pulsed Field System. Your focus on regulatory approval and commercial launch aligns perfectly with my experience building production-ready systems that scale across millions of users.

At Amazon, I architected and managed comprehensive CI/CD infrastructure using AWS CDK, demonstrating the same systems thinking required for your locally hosted Windows-based CI/CD environment. I led the implementation of multi-stage deployment pipelines (alpha/beta/gamma/prod) with automated testing and monitoring, directly supporting cross-functional teams of 8+ engineers. My experience with Kotlin applications achieving 100% test coverage at Amazon Prime Pantry, combined with extensive Python development across multiple projects, positions me well to write and maintain the build chain programs that power your development workflows.

Your requirements align closely with my technical expertise: I have hands-on experience with Azure DevOps for Windows-based CI/CD pipelines from my work at T4G Limited, extensive Python proficiency demonstrated across all my roles, and proven ability to collaborate with development teams to optimize workflows. While I have primarily worked with AWS CDK and Azure DevOps, the principles of CI/CD system design, infrastructure management, and developer workflow optimization translate directly to TeamCity and Jenkins environments. My experience managing physical infrastructure and system capacity planning at Amazon provides the foundation for deploying and managing server lab equipment.

What draws me to Kardium is the opportunity to apply my DevOps expertise in a meaningful healthcare context where system reliability directly impacts patient outcomes. The regulated medical device environment presents an exciting challenge that builds upon my experience with high-stakes systems at Amazon, where 99.9% uptime was critical for millions of users. I am particularly excited about contributing to your regulatory approval phase, where robust CI/CD systems and comprehensive documentation become essential for demonstrating software quality and compliance.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with large-scale CI/CD systems, Python/Kotlin development, and cross-team collaboration can contribute to Kardium's continued success. I am available for an interview at your convenience and excited about the possibility of joining your team during this pivotal moment in bringing life-changing medical technology to patients worldwide.

Sincerely,  
Aviral Garg
