Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer (Hybrid) position at Kardium. With over 8 years of experience developing scalable web applications and integrating complex systems at Amazon, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Kardium's mission of delivering breakthrough atrial fibrillation treatment through The GlobeÂ® Pulsed Field System. Your focus on regulatory approvals and commercial launch aligns perfectly with my experience building production-ready systems that serve millions of users in high-stakes environments.

Throughout my career at Amazon, I have designed and implemented internal software applications that integrate with multiple third-party systems, directly paralleling your requirements for ERP and PLM integration. I architected serverless systems processing 40TB of daily data, developed full-stack applications using Python and React, and integrated external microservices to extend functionality for business stakeholders. My experience includes building FastAPI applications with SQLAlchemy ORM for PostgreSQL/SQLite databases, integrating Yahoo Finance APIs, and creating comprehensive user authentication systems with responsive Bootstrap UIs.

While my primary expertise lies in Python and TypeScript rather than .NET/C# or Java, I have demonstrated strong object-oriented design principles across all my projects and extensive experience with web application development and front-end design. My work spans relational databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite, DynamoDB), third-party API integration (Yahoo Finance, OpenAI, AWS services), and full lifecycle development including testing, deployment, and maintenance. I excel at learning new technologies rapidly and have successfully adapted to various frameworks throughout my career, as evidenced by my transition from C# at university to mastering Python, TypeScript, and cloud technologies.

What draws me to Kardium is the opportunity to apply my software development skills in a meaningful healthcare context where system reliability and quality directly impact patient outcomes. The regulated medical device environment presents an exciting challenge that builds upon my experience with high-stakes production systems at Amazon, where system uptime and data integrity were critical for millions of users. I am particularly excited about working on manufacturing, regulatory, and quality management systems that support life-changing medical technology, and the hybrid work arrangement in Burnaby aligns perfectly with my location preferences.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with complex system integration, web application development, and cross-functional collaboration can contribute to Kardium's continued success. While I would need to develop expertise in .NET/C# or Java, my strong foundation in software engineering principles, proven ability to rapidly master new technologies, and passion for healthcare innovation position me well for this transition. I am available for an interview at your convenience and excited about the possibility of joining your team during this pivotal moment in bringing breakthrough medical technology to patients worldwide.

Sincerely,  
Aviral Garg
