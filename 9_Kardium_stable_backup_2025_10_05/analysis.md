## COMPREHENSIVE POSITION ANALYSIS

### Position 1: Software Developer
**Salary:** $108,000 - $155,000 CAD  
**Experience Required:** 8+ years  
**Risk Assessment:** HIGH RISK - DO NOT PURSUE

#### CRITICAL SKILL GAPS (INSURMOUNTABLE):
- ❌ **ZERO .NET/C# experience** (8+ years required)
- ❌ **ZERO Java experience** (8+ years alternative required)  
- ❌ **No D365 F&O experience** (highly desirable)
- ❌ **No ERP/PLM systems experience**

#### ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS:
- ✅ 8+ years total development experience
- ✅ Web application development expertise
- ✅ Database experience (PostgreSQL, SQLite, DynamoDB)
- ✅ Third-party API integration
- ❌ **30% overall technical match**

#### STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT:
**Fatal Flaws:**
1. **Hard Requirements:** 8+ years in specific technologies with zero experience
2. **Screening Elimination:** ATS systems will filter out based on missing keywords
3. **Interview Impossibility:** Cannot demonstrate core technical competencies
4. **Credibility Damage:** Applying with major gaps harms professional reputation

**Recommendation:** **ABANDON** - Waste of time and potential reputation damage

### Position 2: Senior Software Build Engineer  
**Salary:** $90,000 - $140,000 CAD  
**Experience Required:** 5+ years  
**Risk Assessment:** MODERATE RISK - STRONG PURSUE

#### SKILL ALIGNMENT (STRONG):
- ✅ **Python proficiency** (extensive demonstration)
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline experience** (AWS CDK, multi-stage deployments)
- ✅ **Windows environment** (Texavie development experience)
- ✅ **Azure DevOps experience** (T4G Limited)
- ✅ **Cross-team collaboration** (8+ engineer teams at Amazon)
- ✅ **Infrastructure management** (40TB daily processing systems)
- ✅ **Documentation expertise** (organization-wide workshops)

#### MANAGEABLE GAPS:
- ⚠️ **Kotlin demonstration** (Prime Pantry experience available but underemphasized)
- ⚠️ **TeamCity/Jenkins** (transferable from AWS CDK/Azure DevOps)
- ⚠️ **Medical device experience** (high-stakes systems experience applicable)

#### STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES:
1. **Unique Positioning:** Amazon enterprise-scale CI/CD rare in medical device space
2. **Timing Advantage:** Regulatory approval phase needs robust build systems NOW
3. **Experience Exceeds Requirements:** 8+ years vs. 5+ required
4. **Perfect Mission Alignment:** High-reliability systems directly applicable to patient safety

**Recommendation:** **STRONG PURSUIT** - 70-80% success probability
