## 🎨 Formatting Guidelines

### Text Emphasis Rules

**Bold (`__text__`):**
- Use ONLY for MAIN concepts and key information
- Examples: technologies, company names, role titles, metrics
- **Don't overuse**: Avoid bolding numbers in isolation
- Bold key action verbs and outcomes

**Italics (`*text*`):**
- Use for conversational connecting words
- Examples: "I'm", "At Amazon:", "More recently", "I've", "That's why"
- Creates natural reading flow while maintaining scannability
- Makes answers feel more conversational

**Underline (`__text__`):**
- Use for critical bullet point text that needs emphasis
- Typically used within broader point form structures
- Helps with quick visual scanning

### Emoji Usage

- **Section headers**: Use relevant emojis (💡, 🎯, ❓, 🚨, 📞, 📊, etc.)
- **Checkmarks**: ✅ for positive matches, accomplishments
- **Cross marks**: ❌ for things to avoid
- **Stars**: ⭐ for KEY/important questions
- Keep professional and purposeful

## 📝 Answer Structure

### Point Form with Nesting

```markdown
**Answer**:
- *Opening context* __key concept__
  - *Sub-point with* __specific detail__
    - Nested detail if needed
  - *Another sub-point* __with emphasis__

- *Second major point:*
  - __Specific example__ *with context*
  - __Metric or outcome__

- *Closing statement* __with impact__
```

### Key Principles:

1. **Conversational yet scannable**:

   - Nested bullet structure

2. **Short and terse**:

   - Use conversational language
