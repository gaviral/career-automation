START OF INTERVIEW WITH VOOBAN LABS

Hi, everyone. Hey, Samar. How are you doing?
I'm good. How are you? Very good. Cannot complain. It's good weather here.
Yeah. Amazing. It's
we're finally getting some sunshine here, which is great, but it's been
rainy pretty much all along the weekend. So Tell me about it. Glad about
And I'm so sorry. I hope you weren't waiting too long. I was just jumping off another
call. No. I'm all good. I remember I myself took a long time last
time. So No. No. No worries.
How was your long weekend? Did you do anything? Oh, it was good. I'm just
spent some time with my wife and my dog, and then we went out for a few walks. It was nice
and relaxing. A lot of cleanup in the house.
Likewise. So, like, long weekends are usually Oh, went went perfectly.
And it it on a good note with, like, the the Thanksgiving dinner, the
Thanksgiving we have. Right? So, yeah, like,
I spent that time with family and friends, so that was good.
Amazing. Sounds like a fun relaxing weekend. What about you?
Yeah. No. Mine was honestly pretty much the same. I just a
friend visited from UK, and she just had a baby. So we all went down to the
where we grew up in St. Catharines and had sushi together and just did a lot of cleanup
So yeah. Nice. Nice. I'm glad. Awesome. Well, thank you again
so much for connecting with me again, Abiral. And
just want to make sure again that I am pronouncing it correctly. You are.
You are. It's actually one of the best pronunciation amongst the best, I would say.
I give a hard time to everyone. I remember telling you that as well.
Amazing. I'm happy to hear. And just before getting started,
overall, I do have the AI notetaker. I just want to make sure you're okay with me adding it.
Absolutely. Perfect. Awesome. So just to add
added it now. So great. Like I said, in this call,
is going to be very similar to the last conversation we had. I know it's
scheduled for forty five minutes. It could be anywhere between thirty minutes to one hour. Okay. Just depending on how many questions we're able to get through.
Of course. But it's essentially just
gonna really dig in deeper into your background, so apologies in advance.
Some questions may be a little bit repetitive. And then
we're asking you a few behavioral situational
questions, and then giving you time for any questions you may have. Okay? Of course.
Okay. Perfect. But before we do get started, any questions on your end?
No questions. Just, like, from my own sake, I have
I do have my notes, but if you'd like me to also, like like,
close them or something, like, I'm I'm okay with anything.
No. No. That's totally fine. This is just more so, like, like I said, their behavioral situation
questions, and then really just sticking in your background. So
I do wanna start off. I know you've been with Amazon for quite some
time, so this question will probably be quite short. But we're just
gonna dig in
We usually just try to focus on the past five years, which
has been Amazon for you. So I'd love to hear a little bit more about your
trajectory within Amazon. I guess your main
responsibility, if you will, as well as what has been the biggest impact or success that you've had there?
Right. Well, I've been at Amazon well, for more like, almost, like, five years and more than five years.
And there the trajectory
would be, I would say, like, there was the prime pantry team that I joined.
And then after that, it was the beauty tech team.
Like, bird eye view about the two places, like, the two teams.
Inside Amazon, I would say,
the Prime Pantry team really was, like, the learning about
Amazon way of doing things. I had, like at school, I had learned, like, you know, just
like, foundations of software engineering, done a lot of
projects and whatnot. After that, I joined a cons consultancy
where I'd applied those skills even further
Like, prime pantry at Amazon felt like the perfect
place where I, like, learned to apply that at scale.
And learn the Amazon way of doing things. As I mentioned earlier, it would be
just load testing a lot of infrastructure setup
like, realizing how big the scale is. Like, it's
one thing to hear about it, another thing to actually experience it.
So it was really, like like, a a
a great big experience about, like, learning more and more about how to serve
millions of customers. Right? From there, I would say,
going on to the beauty tech part, like the
bird eye view of that would be, I
worked on, like, multiple projects there, like, back end, front end,
AI related, documentation heavy.
Doing operational readiness for the team, which
is where the documentation readiness comes in.
But, yeah, it was a lot of, like, very different experience where not only now
I was learning about how to operate, and serve,
millions of customers, but also to
like like, come up with, like,
ingenious solutions on my own
and leading people, like, mentoring others. Right?
So that was, like, I'd say the bird eye view trajectory
at Amazon. My main responsibility is, I'd say, more
towards, like, in the beauty tech team, which was the second team. I'd
say, it was more so along the lines of
now I'm not just, like, get being given a small component to work on.
Like I was at at Prime Pantry. It was more so
to, like, take ownership. I was given ambiguity about the task.
And now I have to myself figure out the requirements
take it to design, get it like, recommend
amongst, like, present two or three designs for every project
and recommend one of them and then take it to implementation.
Keep on maintaining it. We're not just leaving it off for the DevOps teams.
But maintaining all of that. And, of course, the topics varied
quite a bit during the beauty tech itself,
But amongst the main responsibilities, I'd say it was
now, like, can you build something from scratch on your own?
You figure out the requirements? We're not going to hand hold our spoon feed everything
requirement to you. You have to work backward from the customers.
What issue are you resolving? What
feature are you building? Why are you building that? Questioning those things
really hammering down on what are we solving. Let's
figure that out, and then we'll worry about right after that, we'd worry about
how to solve that. Right? So understanding the customer
understanding the feature that was necessary part. So of
of my responsibility, I'd say, another part of it another major part was
now could I've learned development at scale.
Understood the requirements. I'm even designing things.
But also now delegating tasks as well.
I'm I'm the like, I'm a lead engineer.
In in the project that I'm working on. Sorry about that.
Actually, give me one second. Yeah.
Because I know, like, it starts a coughing fit, and I was gonna keep on doing that.
Last week, I had, like, a cough attack, so please feel free to
I appreciate it. Okay. So
it was also about mentorship. Like,
giving advice to developers, giving them direction
not giving them too much direction because right now
like, if I really wanted my own whatever
I'm thinking, like, if like, I could just use an agent or, like, you know, like,
agent tech development to make all of that happen, but still there are limitations to those capabilities. So wanting to see how people who I am entering, how they'd come up with a solution. And, of course, time box things would help them with every not just the technical aspect, but even, like, aspects around that, like like, other than the technical aspects, like, be team cohesion and and so on and so forth. Right? So
that would that would be another one of my main responsibilities.
I think your question was a three parter. The first trajectory, second about the main responsibilities. The third one, I'm trying to remember.
It was
It was the biggest impact that you probably had there. Absolutely. A little bit
touched upon it. But Absolutely. Well, I mean, I would say the biggest
impact I'd say is amongst the, like, the VTO project that I worked on
where we served, like, more than 40,000,000 customers.
Monthly where we were doing the augmented reality experience.
And, people would get to try on different makeups
like lipsticks, foundation, and whatnot when they're trying
like, virtually and especially it being
during the COVID time, very difficult times for everyone,
going to the store to buy to purchase
makeup, accessories, and everything and, like, trying them on
during a time where everyone was worried about
things being contagious. Right? So having an augmented reality
experience to just try them on and even having that convenience, it just
kinda lasted forever. It was a good teaching time to a lot of customers. They learned
like, the the technology and and got to experience it.
So, yeah, I would say one of the biggest impacts at at Amazon was definitely, like, having
like like, serving to so many customers at at such a large
scale, much larger than I'd even imagine before
in the Prime Pantry team. Yeah. Yep. Amazing. That's awesome. Well,
you so much for that. And I I know briefly touched up on this last time as well, but just
to confirm, I guess, the main reason for leaving, you mentioned there was a company downsizing.
Yes. Absolutely. So our team was being merged
like a like a beauty tech team.
Was being merged into, like, a different team, and that unfortunately led
led to, like, abrupt, yeah, just, layoffs
Me and my manager and my manager's manager, like, a lot of people were impacted by this.
And it is a yearly thing that happens at Amazon but, like, not in our team. It was, like, kinda happening after five years Like, I mean, mean, at for five years, I had been in
like, this prime boundary team and the beauty tech team. So, like,
in beauty tech, I've never heard of the this happening because we were doing so well.
But, yeah, you know, it it does happen. So yeah.
Okay. Yeah. No. It is unfortunate, but I do appreciate
your transparency there. And I guess the main thing also
that I wanted to check with you, and I think we briefly touched upon this last time, but
obviously coming from a company like Amazon, it's a big company with thousands of employees worldwide.
And I'm sure there's a lot more processes and structure in place in a company like Amazon.
Where as I mentioned within this role, which as a reminder again,
Vuvan Labs is a subsidiary of Vuvan, and Vuvan is a service
company where Vuvan Labs is a product company
and more so developing AI agents from scratch. First for VuBan, customer
customer as your primary customer, and then eventually to external clients.
But like I said, this is pretty much a very early stage or it is an early stage
startup Mhmm. Within VuBan or under the VuBan umbrella. And you would be
developing all of the AI agents from scratch, but there's still a lot of documentation
processes, structure that's not really in place. Mhmm. So
do you feel about moving from an environment like Amazon where, like I said, you know, at least
seems like there's a lot more structure, process, documentation and such.
To the startup environment where it might still be quite ambiguous and unstructured
Absolutely. So, yeah, I think it
yeah. Like, this is something that we touched upon last time as well, which is
essentially, like, like, to me personally, it wouldn't feel like a very
environment. I've been asked this in, like, others, like,
startup, like, interviews where, like,
like, going from such a big company to a small company, how
would this impact, like, and how the adjustment or even, like, just
the transition overall. And I personally feel like
at Amazon, things were, like, so siloed. So
I was siloed in terms of how teams their different teams
they are I wouldn't say siloed that we're not we have been
the best word. But some sometimes it did operate in a way that
at least the how do I put this? They
would be allowed, like, to take
your team, like, the the the team owners they would be allowed to take it in any direction however they want it.
Right? So it wasn't like, here's this this blueprint. Everyone has to follow this.
Beauty tech, baby team, prime pantry. Like, there were so many different, like,
even, fashion Amazon fashion. Everyone was allowed
to operate their team however they wanted. So it really felt like there were so many
start ups working under the umbrella of Amazon. And in there with
like, if anything, I'd say, like, I I've seen with with a bigger company
So having so many options to decide
from seeing, like, how many other teams are working, learning from them,
because their documentation would be there. It would be a great thing, but
sometimes it would also be a bad thing because the documentation would end up
being all over the place. There's so many patterns that we're trying to follow and what
not. So documentation wise, processes wise,
let's say, we did have a lot of, like, learning points from other teams, but at the same time,
it would be, like, so many different ideas coming all together, becoming a mishmash and spaghetti.
Of the whole thing. So it it is very easy for
like, Amazon teams to have that startup culture where we are trying to actually build
building things from scratch, learning from a lot of places, of course, having a lot of resources
helped, but at the same time, cutting through the noise and
delivering what we wanted, working with the right processes that we wanted
maintaining the documentation. Like, these were some big challenges
we all dealt with, and I feel like it would feel pretty much at home
when, like, working, at Vubana, it
say, like like, of course, like, I'd learn more things about
what existing things are already there. But
creating something from scratch or even taking existing things that have been spaghettified
cutting through the noise and delivering the right things.
Would be what I think I'd be doing at Vuvan the way I had done
Amazon.
Yeah. Fantastic. Okay. Awesome. Thank you so much for clarifying that again.
Now
somewhat of an unrelated question, let's say if
you could know a everything that you can possibly know about a topic
unrelated to tech, what would it be?
Unrelated to tech or topic.
Woah. That's
interesting one.
A lot of my hobbies, I had, like like, creating personal assistance and whatnot. I like like
they do the dwell in tech itself. I mean, I think that if
I'm sorry? It could be that if
that's what you'd like to choose. But, yeah, if if that's essentially something that you're very interested
in and something that, you know, you mostly want
learn about, that's totally fine. But if there's something maybe that you're interested in kind of outside of
tech or something that you would want to learn outside of that? I want to learn like, there'd be a lot of things
I want to learn. But, like, in terms of, yeah, calling myself, like like, the more like, what so
so if I understand your question correctly, it's, like, like, what do I know most about other than
tech? It would would Oh, mostly. No. No. It's more so, like, if you could learn
anything about a topic that's unrelated to tech. So it could be anything.
Okay. I think that would be
philosophy is something I would go for because it's there's so much
depth in there. I know there's some some common points even in philosophy and tech
but, like, that's kind of a farfetched because there there's a base common language.
The the logic and whatnot. But
philosophy, learning about all the things that people have talked about and learned about
already in the past because there are so many times that I, like, go in-depth of
learning one area of philosophy, one like how Wittgenstein and
how many different, like, great philosophers out there have
come thought about different things about life.
And that would be something, like, learning from that.
So that I can even take it even further and learning more about it.
I I do enjoy like, I would consider myself a armchair philosopher.
I I don't know. I I would I have to admit, it's only from discussions with my
friends, but it's something that I've thoroughly enjoyed,
different viewpoints about life and everything around it.
Right? So that would be something that I'd love to learn
everything about. If if there was one thing, it would be just
philosophy.
Love that. That's awesome. So what would your approach be then? Like, if you were to go learn something that's
you know, new to you Mhmm.
How would you start? What type of resources would you be looking at?
Well, my knee jerk reaction, I'd say, are, like, the first, like,
idea when you when you asked me asked me that question was
usually, I go with a breadth first search, like getting a bird eye view, having AI
definitely helps with that, makes things easier. I like, I have my own personal assistance.
That I can just like, like, with AI that I just
talked to and be like, they do the web search. They they have control over pretty much my entire
computer. So I I'd, right now, like, literally be just, like, rest
my arms. And the first thing would be give me the bird's eye view
of philosophy, of what different aspects of philosophy are there.
What like and and just, like, give me one sentence.
Like, if I'm intrigued by something, I'd want to go deeper into that. But
usually, in a structured approach would be not getting bogged down into just
one aspect of it. It would be just, like, at level one what's everything? What do I need to know? And then go down one more level
further one more level. And if there was an
angle with philosophy, something as, open, as philosophy,
I don't know if there is, like, one specific goal, but if there was one, let's say,
really want to understand maybe after getting
a few, like, through a few levels of depth, I want to really learn about that
one aspect of philosophy. I want to go deeper
it would be, like,
goal oriented if the concept of goal
would appear in this particular area.
But in philosophy, I'd I'd say it's a little open ended, but
yeah. Yeah. No. That's fantastic. And I guess, would you say
that's pretty much your approach to learning anything, like whether it is tech
or nontech. Is that kind of similar to your approach? I would
say that, like, I mean, that was, like, you know, just
off the top of my head. Like, this is how I generally think about things.
At first where there's a combination of breath first and then going into depth
But, like, it really depends because it sometimes the breath needs to be literally
just quick one thing, and I clearly know with the when the goal part appears,
it may be sorry. It may appear even early on, but
I I would say, yeah. Like, the answer to that question, I I believe, would be yes.
I do have this combination of breadth first and depth first search
combined together. When the goal appears, it's more so, like, kind of
narrowing it down towards the depth while still having a good understanding of what's happening in other branches.
Awesome. Good first. Perfect. Thank you so much for that.
Okay. Cool. Now can you describe a time maybe where you had
difficulty completing a task? You know, how did you feel during that
time? What did you do to really get through that period?
I'd say one example, I I remember the situation I was in was
actually a component of this VTO project itself.
Where I had discussed
with my manager about some deadlines and
we were on track overall for, like, the larger project.
Whereas for one initial demo,
I saw myself, like, you know, just it happened to be, like, a time where
a lot of, like, vacation coincided with a lot of people.
Like, in the team, and that was something, like, a
I'd say, like, towards the end, I I should talk about that, but it's more so, like,
the learning point about, like, also thinking about certain things that just
show up sometimes. But, anyways,
so their, the issue had been, like,
I wasn't able to have the demo ready
for, like, the first component like, for the second component of the video project.
Where we were expected to, like, present something
And the task I took upon myself in that situation was
to figure out what can we still demo
what parts are more critical because
was a little bit of development happening on a lot of
like different subcomponents. So then we well, like, that's
fine. These kind of things happen. I talked to the, like,
the junior developers in the team as well, and, like, they were kinda worried
like, that this is this is part and parcel. And
we are going to take that as a learning point. Right? So anyways,
what we did essentially was we focused on just one like, critical aspect and we were like, these are somewhat like of bonus features. We
for now. Like, now, our p p zero, we can filter it out.
Take a few of the p zero, like, priorities
put that to p one, and it's okay to punt it to the next
demo. Right? So that was something that we ended up doing.
And the impact of this essentially was
we were able to demonstrate, like, the product
that we wanted to show. The showcase here was actually with the I should
have been more specific. It was around, like, the ground truth data labeling part.
Where, we wanted to showcase that with the pipeline that we have already
created of data ingestion, getting all the product images. I
I'm kind of building on on some things that I've already said in the last interview, but
essentially where we were creating the three d models of the lip
there it was like we had the
images. Now we have to send that to data labelers.
So sending that to data labelers, having the perfect
HTML setup and is like, all the different aspects of
having the pipeline a 100% connected to
this data labeling and automatically getting those things back.
That was kind of like what we had to demo during the weekly
roundtable kind of thing. So that's where we said that's
fine if it's not connected to the main pipeline. Let's actually just show
some demo cases of what that we can still send the label data and
get it back. And the kind of data we are getting because we wanted to deliver
it to our applied scientists and data scientists for them to see what
structure is there for such a thing and how they would model the jobs in the future
And, yeah, we'll be we're able to demonstrate that data
scientists and really, like, the booking backward really helped us.
Because main parts of this demo was
for the data centers to be able to get that data and get the process to
get that that data, and they were able to, learn from that.
And the noncritical tasks kind of got punted.
And we were able to deliver that along with the next deliverables on time after that.
Awesome. Great. When you're usually going through a difficult
time or, you know, have a difficult time, I guess, finishing a task or so,
would you usually in that case, like, are you someone that's comfortable
whether leaning on your team or your manager for that help, or do you really try
to kind of figure things out on your own before making that
I think it would be more so somewhat of hybrid of the two.
Where I would not just come up with the problem. Like, I have
like, I would like, the manager needs to know about it.
They like, they they need to be aware of, hey. Like,
junior developers under me, like, they have some issues even sometimes I myself
If we are not able to complete a task,
sometimes, like, even with the buffer time there, the
everyone above me needs to know about it, while at the same time,
like, going there with just the problem is not something I personally do.
Like, what I try to do is here's the situation that we are in.
Here's a proposed solution as well along with it.
So I'd work with, like, immediately, but but the timeline of of
of all of this would be all very fast. Right? Like, come up with
some sort of a quick solution. And even if sometimes I cannot come up with a solution,
it's just like these are the different approaches. Let me ask questions the right way.
Right? So it would be kind of a mixture of the two,
But first and foremost, my idea is to
here's the problem. Here are the different things that I've explored from that exploration.
That I think would help because working backward in this particular case was
data scientists needed that data, needed the process to
extract the data. So those are critical points. Let's definitely do those. The
These are the things that we cannot do right now that is okay.
But let's also communicate that to, like, leadership
And in terms of what we are able to achieve or if we want to push back the demo,
let's do that. So it would be keeping them in the loop,
Of course, if they want to be part of the process as well, that's fine and dandy.
But from from my side, I think I'd like to present
propose recommendations and different options that that we
have once facing a problem. Awesome.
Perfect. Thank you for that. Now
let's say that because, of course, in this role, this is an early stage start up, as I mentioned, and
let's say you're working directly with the CEO on a prototype
and you strongly disagree with the proposed approach.
What would you do in that situation? So in this case, you're asking, like, the pro
approach has been given by the CEO that this is how we should proceed.
Exactly. Okay. I think
like, I've had situations in the past where I had a disagreement with
a senior engineer. And in that case, they had proposed an approach
for, like that we should have server systems instead of serverless.
Whereas I strongly disagreed with that that I think we should have
serverless architecture for the the main part of the pipeline.
And in this, I my approach with their
was to, like, quickly discuss bet between him, like,
making sure are we on the same page about all the pros and cons about both sides.
And even then at in this particular case, we
stayed on, like, the different sides of, like, the
the the the disagreement here.
So what we did was essentially, like and and this is something
that I learned from Amazon. I really enjoyed that that we
come up with, like, a document, a quick one pager understanding
really trying to understand the other person's perspective and list out the design. Like,
his like, what he like, I came up with. Here's the proper design.
And here's for for server and the serverless side.
We both actually wrote down all the points in that. We'd
we collectively created the design in our case and then wrote down some comments.
These are correct or not. And once that was ready, we both actually ourselves
agreed that, okay, there was rather there was one a third different solution as well in in
all of this, which was the part of it use servers, part of it
use serverless. We actually looked at all three, but we actually ended up
agreeing that serverless would be the way to go because of cost reasons.
And different other reasons, and we were able to reach that agreement part.
So and we were able to do that, like, quickly in a matter of two days.
Now if you're asking me how does this would happen with the CEO,
I'm not sure if that would be something like we'd work on a document
together. Maybe, may not be most likely. I don't think that would be the case.
But in this particular case, what I'd be doing is
again, at least presenting, this is why I think this
is the proposed solution, and there would be openness towards understanding
the other side of things. And, like, having the pros and cons listed out
and then having like, presenting it presenting it
and really learning about working backward from
why do should we pick one or the other.
I present it, and then from there, we would take it from essentially that.
And if there are things that just
I'm not sure, like, if confidentiality or, like, different other kind of things
There are some business reasons, then there are those
reasons. Right? Like, then, like, those are some things that just become part of
that document itself, and we
like, put that as a learning point for ourselves, and then we take things from there. Right?
So essentially, the idea is not to just go into disagreement and, like,
like, thing things are quite logical. Like, they're quite logical
steps out there, which essentially would be to compare the things and
get get on the same page and then move forward with that.
Okay. And let's say you did all of that, but
the CEO is still kind of, you know, I don't know his approach.
Well, I think usually in that case,
if if it looks like something that's just
yeah, it is biz there are business reasons, and we do put that point in there.
And we we move forward with that. Right? Like, because it is something if
a CEO is adamant. And here, like, my understanding is,
I feel like like if we need to chalk it down
to business reasons, right, then then we
put that in there. We put that into the design decisions that we are taking.
And then we move forward with, like, maybe even contingencies.
That that this is something that we just have to do
It is almost like working backward. Right? Like, because as a CEO, you do understand
there are, like, executive operations that that you need
to be mindful of. And with that additional knowledge, we do put that down
And, also, we are going with
server in instead of serverless for, like, re like,
for this hypothetical example, then
whatever contingencies that we can put in place
to make sure that because there are certain reasons why I think the other approach would be bad.
But it's still doable. Not like, things are not always black and white. Right?
We do put those contingencies in place. We
need if needed, extend the timeline a little bit.
If if that's not possible. Like, just essentially
what are things can we make sure to try the
take care of the disadvantages that would be happening by that other approach.
And move forward with that.
Cool. Yeah. Perfect. Thank you for that.
Actually, one thing can I add to that if you don't mind?
It would be, like, there are always some certain times, like, one way door and
way door decisions. And, like, one way door would be, like, you know, we are you're losing customer
trust where you're, like yeah. Like, two way door way doors is, something you
can even change later on. So that is also something I do always consider before thinking about
is it even worth spending time on? Like, like, not everything is about
like, oh, it is my way or the highway. It's never that, to be honest.
But it's it's more so sometimes, is it even worth
discussing about because sometimes things are things can be done in a modular way where you can
even just swap certain parts out if and when needed.
Kind of thing. Right? So that would be the first step. And then after that,
would be the process that I explained earlier. Yeah.
Okay. Perfect. No. Thank you. Now let's say that you ship
an agent to production, and three days later, an internal user says that
not answering well. What's your next move?
I've deployed an internal agent at an internal agent, you said?
Yeah. You you shipped an agent to production. Mhmm.
Three days later, an internal user says that it's not
answering well. What's your next move?
Next move is actually to work backward from that. Like, look into our
essentially, like, the entire entire trace back path.
Looking into exactly what's happening and
what went wrong and understanding what should have happened
then trying to trace it back to, like, the explainability parts of agents and AI, what exactly
should have happened, why did it not happen,
But, yeah, like, it would be a step by step approach from backward
from that way particular query.
Perfect. Now I have
two scenarios or two options here for you, and let me know which is more
I guess,
a little less
comfortable for you or a little bit more uncomfortable. So the first option is that you and I
are very close colleagues, and I seriously dropped the ball on the code
quality, and you need to address it with me. Mhmm. And the second option is vice versa.
You're being challenged by me on your code quality.
Which would be more uncomfortable for you?
I honestly, like, my first thought about this is
like, I don't see them to be very uncomfortable to begin with either of them.
Okay. Is that an an answer? Or
if I had to pick one, is it one of those questions?
Exactly. If you had to pick one, what would you prefer? Would you prefer
I
know, talk to you about your code quality or you address this with me?
And it's just more so of, like, a level of comfort. Are you comfortable
kind of telling people is your preference to have to tell people that they dropped the
the the the bar, I guess, on their quality code? Or
are you a little bit more comfortable if people address it with you?
Honestly, like, I do not like, it would be so hard to say because, like, it's
not even that they're equal. It's, like, both cases are
just not uncomfortable at all because these are very essential parts
of, like, development, team development,
code development that you need, like, feedback
Like, if there's something wrong, please talk about it.
Like like, I encourage you, but at the same time,
if there's something wrong with your code, like, I like,
this needs to be addressed. And, we we talk about it
Of course, we we first do the it worth the time
part? Like, as in, like, there's always a cost benefit analysis to everything and not
every time do you need to you you have to always prioritize all the right things. Now
like, it would be a coin flip. Like,
if I'm being very honest with you. So it's like if I had to answer one,
I'd flip a coin and I'd respond back to you with that. And I don't know if that's satisfying.
Satisfactory to you. No. No. That's totally fair. And I appreciate that.
Okay. What kind of projects would you say really just
gets you into a flow state where you almost lose track of time?
Oh, can it be personal project here?
Yeah. It would be building, like, AI agents, AI assistants,
and lots of prompt engineering. And honestly, like, I think biggest
in the here would be work like, so I have a personal assistant
Bob. So working on Bob really helps
me get, like, get into the flow where I am just
sitting, like or actually even pacing around or just, like, you know, just walking around.
The house and talking to Bob and asking it to do things for me where just
I think yesterday, added features where, like,
it was, like, being able to send email, like, you know, send my
essentially, like, my my my key three key goals about
like, what are what are the three biggest goals for tomorrow? Send an email to myself
So I just, like, added that feature where
automatically cap like, gets that data in
from internally from my computer, like, where I've saved, like, the biggest
things that I need to do for tomorrow. And, it
grabs that. It the the new feature that I added was the
being able to connect to the mail app, the Apple mail app.
And it would just essentially, like, put that data in there,
find the contact, which would be myself, and send that email.
Up to myself. So working on, I think,
like, personal assistant projects
is especially driven by voice driven where
don't have to look at the screen for way too long. It's something that I'm
thoroughly enjoy. Amazing. And and
do you sustain your energy? Like, when you're working on a project for so long and you're just kinda heads down,
working on it for a while, how do you really sustain your energy and
pace yourself so you don't get burnt out? Oh, a 100%.
This is actually one of the first things that I built into Bob itself
A lot of my friends are like, okay. Yeah. You should
just name yourself Bob or something like that. I don't know. Oh,
but I this is one of the first things that I built. I'm, like, big
into about where am I drinking enough water?
Like, very primary things. Like, one thing I learned was if you're not
protein like, I I'd give you a very small simple example of, like,
how I learned protein as one of the big parts of
big components of neurotransmitters. It's not just for muscle building.
You want for your serotonin and dopamine, the things that give you
like, energy and enthusiasm throughout the day, the motivation throughout the day.
You don't have that in your bloodstream
You don't have enough water, like, like, you know, in your bloodstream.
You cannot be motivated. You cannot be
enthusiastic. You you you won't even be, like, happy or even neutral state.
You'd be going in the other direction. You don't want that. So I kind of worked
like, from, like, very foundational things of
am I drinking enough water? So, like, one thing I quickly implemented was
something and this is very small, I know, minute example, but
for me, I think it had a big impact was
taking care of myself, meditating,
like like, doing daily meditations.
Even going to therapy. Like, it's just something that I just
you know, like, keeping a check. So therapy is not just something that I see as
fixing something, but it's even more to
like, why not go be the 10 x of yourself. Yeah. So not just
yeah, as fixing something, but more like let's live in the luxury
luxurious life of, like, keeping things in check
and being mindful about different things.
So a combination of these, like, do a self care
mechanisms that I have set up for myself, something from as primary as
as drinking water, having enough protein throughout the day,
and keep, like, taking good breaks, not just
throughout the day, but even, like, vacation time as well.
Spending quality time reflecting on all the things that matter, like,
treating every pillar of life, really, and and folk keeping a good check
is how I personally, like, maintain the enthusiasm
and not reaching a burnout.
That that's awesome. So, essentially, you kinda have the agent. You built, like, an
a reminders within the agent that will tell you about
whether to drink water and things like that? It's it's more so, like, that was
a more so an example of how things get baked into. Not everything is driven by it, but
more so slowly as I add new features into the agent that does
help me with those things so that I can, think about other things
Like, I've thought about something already before if I can automate that
that would help me. If there are any issues with automation, I'll come back and look at it.
But, essentially, like, now it's part of my toolkit
Right? It sometimes can be an agent. It sometimes can be just simple habits.
Like, you know, just whenever I get up, like and, like,
I just take my glass of water with me and just kinda go. So it doesn't have to be always
driven by an agent, but it's more so, like, just thoughtfulness about
if I'm feeling, like, not enthusiastic or if I'm feeling
sad, like, you know, just then why kind of I'm feeling that?
And let's see how I can address it. So set up a mechanism
It may be agent involved. It may be, like, outside of that, but really just
thoughtful, my being mindful about things, being
like, about and working backward from the issue.
Is is how I'd go even outside of work.
That's awesome. Okay. No. Fantastic. Thank you
for sharing that. I know we're coming close to time
and I just have two more questions for you if that's
okay. Are you good to go a little bit over? Of course.
Okay. Fantastic. Actually, sorry. Can you give me one moment? I do have to check
one calendar. Oh, yeah. No. I'm good. Like, 11:30.
I'm good till 11:30. Okay. Amazing. I
hopefully, it it shouldn't be more than, like, ten more minutes of your time. Sounds good.
Yeah. Let's say that a colleague with the same level of experience comes to you for help
to solve a bug, but the same type of bug keeps coming up
over the following weeks, and they don't seem to really learn from it. And they come
to you asking pretty much the same question. Mhmm.
How do you react in that situation?
I think it's, like,
what what my my per like, personal take would be on
kinda helping them through the next time. So
like, maybe asking them about, like, what so
I think, to be honest, like, pretty much every time I would
like,
first like, the the ingestion of that from my side or actually or my
first reaction to all of that would always be, let's learn about, like,
exactly what your problem is, what did you do to solve that, like,
how what what were the exploration points from you? What branches?
What dead dead ends did you hit? And with that,
I think a lot of times with with these kind of situations, especially that
has happened to me in the past where just doing this kind of process
helps, the other person if this
we are in that situation realize that, hey.
It is actually very similar to what happened last time because
yeah, you ex like, sometimes what happens is they didn't
explore enough things, but what's and and they're like, oh, thank you.
Me in the right direction because, like, honestly, you did all the job here.
I only asked you, like, you know, tell me what all things did you
explore. And they as they're answering that question many a times, I act
end up acting as a soundboard where they're like, oh, wait. This is something I forgot to
Let me go and look into this s three bucket that I didn't think about.
Sometimes when they have gone to that exact same thing,
they actually end up saying, oh, these
first, second, third, fourth, all of these
were the exact issues that I had faced that that I had explored last time.
I hit the exact same dead ends. Oh, wait. What did I do last time? I did that
I'm sorry I bothered you. I'm like, that's completely fine. Like, let's proceed with that.
If I've not been in a situation where someone would, like, know, fourth, fifth,
time, they would come back with that. But in my case, it would be just
okay. Do you remember that we did come up with the exact same thing
Like, this exploration process feels very similar.
Would you like to take a guess
where we what what we did in that particular case?
I'm assuming that they would go in that direction. Let's say they still don't get it because
even though those things may be as clear to me, it may not be as clear to them.
So, like, I think the next step would be to help them understand that
Of course, it's not always, doesn't have to be always, like,
time consuming. This usually isn't time consuming, but
yeah. Like, this I I I think this is where I'm
I'm now going more and more into hypotheticals of, what
further would happen. But I think my approach initially always would be, like, let's
talk about the exploration and then
yeah. If you're pressed on time, it's, like, two minutes before the demo.
Like, here's here's the fix, obviously.
Or or let's kind of work on it together. Like, I think it would always be pure
way, but, like, peer programming route. But
yeah, like, the exploration part definitely helps
me and the other person to ask questions the right way.
And, yeah, do their due diligence and
can help always help them with that. Yeah. But what if you've done this, let's
say, two to three times already Mhmm. And they kinda still seem to be asking
you the same questions. I I could ask them that
let's how about we document this? Like, because it's
seems to be definitely a recurring issue in the system and and all your
explorations as well because I think it would be a great learning point. And then we can always refer back
to it. It's it's something that I think and we can even talk about, like,
if it feels to a point where, like, even after
let's say, even after documentation,
sorry.
Like, even after a
and referring to it, like, let's say they do come back
again after that, then we can even see if there are any
other issues surrounding it. Like, we can
I would create keep providing that safe environment for them to
be able to talk about? Like, if there are some other issues that are, like, just
something yeah. Like, kind of, like, go going more into
is there some more time that you'd need in general
like, to be able to
get your documentation and different other processes in place, would you like
like I'd offer, some more help in that matter? Like,
maybe some core issue about just right now, have
many things happening. Like, I I'm I can never
predict exactly what's happening on other person's, place. I can always just
try to offer that that help and, be in a state where I can
let's see how we can work on this together and kinda help you
figure the issue out, provide that safe space
to to be able to even talk about it. And if there are other help
we can provide, like, maybe some additional time bandwidth
in in your workflow, maybe a dedicated time for just
you know, getting your documentation together, maybe using some agentic
tools that could help you with that. So I think it would really be about
further into working backward from the I feel like this I'm
going to be a broken record and keep on saying the word working backward from the issue, from the problem, but
that really does help in pretty much every aspect of
tech and non tech life. Absolutely.
That's awesome. So it seems then that you tend to manage things directly then.
Would you ever, at any point, get a team lead or a manager involved?
I mean, that can be part of the the process itself. Right? Like, if that is
kind of what's needed, like, it would not be it's never like, I don't see team leads or
managers. Like, here, I am kind of complaining about you or anything. It's more so, like,
if that is needed, which we can obviously, like, quickly see,
then, like, let's involve them. Right? Like, it was like, it would be
maybe talking to the manager themselves, like, that just
like, I feel like the person could use some help in this particular area, and I think
you are the right person to help them. Because if it's about
maybe they need two more developers under under under them and maybe they
may have taken too much. So, like, sometimes it would be like, can I help you as if
sometimes it might be through the manager because
manager can help with the us assigning all the right resources? Right?
Like yeah. So it would be, like, really depending on the situation.
Amazing. Okay. Perfect. My final question to you is just
are you outside of work? What do you like to do for fun? Not sure if you have any hobbies, interests,
Definitely. I think I've I'd say, like, going on hikes with my dog definitely is a
one of the big things that I enjoy. So
Snowboarding is something that I've picked up here
in Vancouver. Like, we have one of the world's best mountains at at
least that's what we'd like to brag about. So
we do enjoy like, yeah, me and my wife, we do enjoy that.
And every now and then, I'd play chess
read books. Like, lately, I haven't
reading a lot of books, I'd say. Because, yeah, like, going into Bob and working adding more features to it is something I'd
I've been doing a little too much, I'd say.
But, yeah, it's it's something
what else? I think badminton is something I I just
like it's it's my big passion. I enjoy playing that a lot.
And, yeah, like, hanging out with friends and
discovering new things is something
like that that's very near and dear to me. Fantastic.
Amazing. Awesome, Admiral. Well, that's really everything I needed to
ask you today, so thank you so much for your time. How did you find that and any questions on your end?
I think this was great. I I really enjoyed the process. And, yeah, the diving
a lot of these different aspects, it was fun and
I I felt like it was a great interview. In terms of it's
thank you so much for, yeah, setting that up, and it was it was quite fun, to be honest.
No. It's not your typical, I guess,
interview, if you will, but hopefully you enjoyed some of the questions. Oh, I've I've
I can't think of an a question that I didn't enjoy, to be honest.
Like, because, yeah, there were parts that I've not thought about before.
That is something that, again, is something so enjoyable and
yeah, it was fun. So not just parts
some of the questions, I think I'd say pretty much all of them.
Fantastic. I do have question about, like,
like, how the next steps and everything would look like
but I'm assuming you're almost getting to that the same thing. Yeah.
Absolutely. So and I know you mentioned as well that you were interviewing, so it's,
to hear, I guess, if there's any progress on that as well. But
I'll be honest with you, and I think I may have mentioned this to you last time that
we do have a few candidates in the final stages. Mhmm. And
right now, I may have mentioned, but because we just have the one opening by end of this year Mhmm. And we do
anticipate to have more openings. So I essentially just want to meet with the team, say
out exactly what
goal would be. Like, even if, let's say, we do move forward with one of the other candidates, like I mentioned,
still have at least one or maybe even more openings.
So it's something that I'd love to kinda just really
with the team and figure out if we can move forward or not, whether now or later.
But I really did enjoy the conversation with you, so it's just a matter of waiting until I
back regarding, the interview process with some of the other candidates,
we will be moving forward with offer if the team wants to meet with more candidates now or kind of hold off
now. So I'll I'll get back to you ASAP. But I know you mentioned
that you are interviewing as well. Have there been any changes with your
availability or anything that we should know regarding your availability?
And, like, time calendar availability
for the interview or, like, in general, like, have I gotten an offer? Yeah. Right. Just, you know, like, do you
feel like you're gonna be getting an offer maybe within the next
don't know, week or two so we know whether we need to get back
to you sooner than later. Obviously, either way, I'll do my best to get back to you before end
of this week, but it may not be until early next week. So I just wanted to know what that looks like with your timeline.
Of course. So I am in, like, the
last stage with one company, and then there are, like, a few other good
companies that I, like, have been referred to. So
there, they have expedited the process because of
all the other interviews that I'm, I'm in. So right now, in terms of, like,
getting an offer, I am expecting something by the end of this week
or early next week Okay. From one company. But, like, with
other like, I think three companies is where I am
in intermediates. Like, go we I've transitioned from early to intermediate,
stages. And, with, like, I think two companies
two to three companies, I'm I'm like like, they just reached out, like, as
I had applied last week or the week before. So, like, with
with remaining companies, essentially, I am in early stages.
So that would be my status in terms of where I am with all the other companies.
Companies.
Perfect. Okay. Amazing. Awesome. Well, again,
I do appreciate that transparency overall, and I'll do my best, like I said, to get
to you sooner than later, but it may not be until early next week. If anything does change with
your availability or if you have any questions, please do feel free to reach out.
Mhmm. But like I said, I'll I'll get back to as soon as I can on
my end. Definitely. Thank you so much, Amar.
Thank you as well. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, and, yeah, we'll stay in touch.
You too. Cheers. Alright. Take Bye.
