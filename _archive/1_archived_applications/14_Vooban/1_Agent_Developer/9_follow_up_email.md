**Subject**: Thank you - Availability for next round

Hi Samar,

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me yesterday about the Agent Developer role at Vooban Labs. I really enjoyed our conversation and learning more about the exciting work happening at Vooban Labs.

I'm particularly enthusiastic about the opportunity to build AI agent solutions from the ground up and work closely with the CEO and COO to define the architecture. The focus on creating internal solutions first, then expanding to external clients, aligns perfectly with my experience at Amazon where I led the development of Project Scott from concept to full deployment.

I'm very excited about the possibility of contributing to Vooban Labs' growth and bringing my experience with multi-agent systems, LLM frameworks, and building solutions in ambiguous environments to the team.

Here is my availability for the next round:

- **Tuesday, October 14**: 9:00 AM - 10:30 AM PDT
- **Wednesday, October 15**: 8:00 AM - 11:00 AM PDT  
- **Thursday, October 16**: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM - 2:30 PM PDT

I'm happy to accommodate your schedule and look forward to our deeper conversation about my background and experience.

Thank you again for your time and consideration. Please let me know if you need any additional information in the meantime.

Best regards,  
Aviral Garg
