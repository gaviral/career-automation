# Iteration 1: Hello World Console - Requirements

## Feature Overview
Create a basic console-based Q&A system that demonstrates the fundamental interaction pattern of Project Scott.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Question Input
- User can type questions in the console
- System displays a prompt: `User: `
- Multi-line input is not required (single line)
- Input is case-insensitive

### FR2: Response Output
- System responds with "Scott: " prefix
- Response acknowledges the question
- Response is friendly and helpful tone
- Response indicates this is a basic version

### FR3: Interaction Loop
- System continuously accepts questions
- After each response, prompt for next question
- Loop runs indefinitely until exit command

### FR4: Exit Handling
- User can type "quit" or "exit" to terminate
- Ctrl+C gracefully terminates the program
- Goodbye message displayed on exit

### FR5: Console Formatting
- Clean, professional output
- Clear separation between user input and system response
- No errors or warnings in normal operation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- Response time: <100ms (instant for hello world)
- No memory leaks during extended sessions

### NFR2: Usability
- Simple, intuitive interface
- Clear instructions on startup
- Professional appearance

### NFR3: Maintainability
- Clean, readable code
- Well-commented
- Easy to extend in future iterations

## Out of Scope (Future Iterations)
- Actual documentation lookup
- Semantic understanding
- LLM integration
- File I/O
- Complex logic

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User can type questions and receive responses
- [ ] System runs in continuous loop
- [ ] Clean exit with "quit" or "exit" command
- [ ] Ctrl+C handled gracefully
- [ ] Professional console output
- [ ] No crashes or errors in normal operation

## Example Interaction
```
========================================
    Project Scott - Iteration 1
    Documentation Q&A System
========================================

Welcome to Project Scott!
Ask me questions about documentation, or type 'quit' to exit.

User: What is the RGB value for unicorn red?
Scott: Thanks for your question! In this demo version, I'm acknowledging your question: "What is the RGB value for unicorn red?"
In future iterations, I'll be able to search documentation and provide real answers!

User: quit
Scott: Goodbye! Thanks for using Project Scott.
```

## Technical Constraints
- Python 3.10+
- No external dependencies (stdlib only)
- Single file implementation
- Console-only (no GUI)
