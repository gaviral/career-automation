**User**

here we go

---

**Cursor**

I'll now execute the Bob-Cursor interaction loop as specified. Starting with Step 1 to run `bob-cursor` and get your speech-to-text instructions.

**Step 2: Formulate Plan**

Based on the transcript "Should I just write agile in there? Is there anything better that I can write in this resume? Here we go.", I need to:

1. Read the currently focused resume file to understand the context
2. Analyze where "agile" might be mentioned or where it could be improved
3. Suggest better alternatives or enhancements for agile-related content
4. Provide specific recommendations for resume improvement

**Step 3: Execute Tasks**

Now let me also check the job description to understand what specific skills or methodologies they're looking for:

**Step 4: Report Results**

Looking at your resume, I can see "Agile" appears in line 8 in the Core Engineering skills section. Here are better alternatives and improvements:

**Instead of just "Agile", consider these enhanced options:**

1. **"Agile/Scrum Methodologies"** - More specific and shows you know the framework
2. **"Agile Development (Scrum, Kanban)"** - Shows familiarity with multiple approaches  
3. **"Cross-functional Agile Collaboration"** - Emphasizes teamwork (important for EA's cross-functional environment)
4. **"Agile CI/CD Integration"** - Connects to your strong CI/CD experience

**Best recommendation for EA specifically:**
Replace "Agile" with **"Cross-functional Agile Development"** because:
- EA emphasizes collaboration with tech artists, content creators, data scientists, writers, and game engine programmers
- Your Amazon experience shows you led teams of 8 engineers, designers, and data scientists
- It aligns with EA's focus on "partner teams" and "shared solutions across different EA domains"

**Additional resume enhancement suggestion:**
Consider adding "Rapid Prototyping" or "Fast Development Cycles" to your skills since EA specifically mentions "accelerate product development cycles and enable rapid experimentation."

**Step 5: Repeat Cycle**

**Step 2: Formulate Plan**

Based on the transcript "Actually, you know what? Remove Agile. So where would be a good place to mention CloudFormation? In the resume? Here we go.", I need to:

1. Remove "Agile" from the skills section
2. Identify optimal placement for CloudFormation in the resume
3. Make the edit to add CloudFormation in the best location
4. Ensure CloudFormation placement aligns with EA's requirements

**Step 3: Execute Tasks**

Looking at the resume, I can see CloudFormation should be prominently featured since EA specifically requires "infrastructure-as-code tools (CloudFormation)" and you have extensive AWS CDK experience. The best approach is:

1. Remove "Agile" from line 8
2. Add CloudFormation to the Cloud Computing skills section (line 9) where it logically belongs

```markdown
• **Core Engineering:** System Design, Python, Flask, FastAPI, Node.js, React, Docker, CI/CD.
```

Let me read the current file again to see the exact content:

I can see the file has already been modified - "Agile" was removed and the formatting changed. CloudFormation is already mentioned in line 9. Let me check if the formatting needs to be fixed to match the original bullet point style:

```markdown
• **Core Engineering:** System Design, Python, Flask, FastAPI, Node.js, React, Docker, CI/CD.
• **Cloud Computing:** AWS CDK, CloudFormation, S3, EC2, ECS, CloudWatch, X-Ray, SAM, Step Functions, Lambda, DynamoDB, Athena, Glue, SNS, SQS, SageMaker, API Gateway.
• **Artificial Intelligence:** OpenAI-Agents, Ollama, Agentic Orchestration, AI agents, Agents Framework, MCP Servers, RAG.
• **Machine Learning:** EDA, Feature Engineering, Vector Databases, NLP, LLM, Time-Series, tsfresh, TPOT, Synthetic Data.
• **Integrations:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Deepgram, Yahoo Finance | **Tools:** Cursor, Co-pilot, JetBrains, Linear, Playwright.
```

Let me read the current state again to see the exact formatting:

Perfect! I can see that:
1. Agile has already been removed from Core Engineering (line 8)
2. CloudFormation is already prominently placed in the Cloud Computing section (line 9) 
3. The formatting is consistent with bullet points using "-" instead of "•"

The changes have already been made correctly. CloudFormation is now well-positioned in the Cloud Computing section where it logically belongs, and it's early in the list which gives it good visibility for EA's requirements.

**Step 4: Report Results**

Great news! The changes have already been implemented:

1. ✅ **Agile removed** from Core Engineering skills section
2. ✅ **CloudFormation prominently placed** in the Cloud Computing section (line 9)

CloudFormation is now positioned perfectly for the EA role because:
- It's in the **Cloud Computing** section where it logically belongs
- It appears **early in the AWS services list** (2nd item after AWS CDK)
- It directly matches EA's requirement for "infrastructure-as-code tools (CloudFormation)"
- It's grouped with other AWS services they specifically mention (Lambda, SAM, API Gateway, DynamoDB, etc.)

Your resume now better aligns with EA's technical requirements while maintaining clean organization.

**Step 5: Repeat Cycle**

**Step 2: Formulate Plan**

Based on the transcript asking about AI/ML tools mentioned in the EA job description, I need to:

1. Read the job description file (task_2_formatted_jd.md) thoroughly
2. Analyze the specific mention of "AI/ML tools to enable fast development and deployment"
3. Identify what specific AI/ML tools they likely mean based on context
4. Cross-reference with current industry standards and the resume requirements

**Step 3: Execute Tasks**

Now let me search for any additional context about AI/ML tools in the broader job applications folder:

**Step 4: Report Results**

Based on my analysis of the EA job description, here are the **AI/ML tools** they're referring to for "fast development and deployment of intelligent applications":

**Explicitly Mentioned AI Tools (from line 35):**
1. **Coding agents** - AI assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor AI, or similar tools that help write code
2. **AWS AI tools** - Amazon's AI services like Bedrock, CodeWhisperer, etc.
3. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - For connecting AI models with external data sources
4. **n8n** - Low-code automation platform for building workflows and integrations

**Additional Context from Job Description:**
- **SageMaker** (mentioned in AWS services) - Amazon's ML platform for model training/deployment
- **ML/Generative AI technologies** - They want someone who can leverage existing AI models
- **Model inference pipelines** - Real-time AI model serving infrastructure
- **Automation pipelines** - AI-powered development acceleration tools

**What EA Likely Wants:**
They're looking for someone who can use **modern AI development accelerators** to build applications faster, including:
- AI coding assistants for rapid prototyping
- Low-code/no-code AI workflow tools
- AWS native AI services for quick deployment
- Integration tools that connect AI models to business systems

**Your Resume Alignment:**
Your resume already mentions relevant tools like "OpenAI-Agents, Agentic Orchestration, AI agents, MCP Servers" which directly align with their requirements for MCP and coding agents experience.

**Step 5: Repeat Cycle**

**Step 2: Formulate Plan**

I need to:

1. Extract all skills mentioned in the SKILLS section of the resume
2. Extract all technologies/tools mentioned in the EXPERIENCE section
3. Compare the two lists to find skills mentioned in SKILLS but not in EXPERIENCE
4. Sort these missing skills by importance for the EA role
5. Present a prioritized list

**Step 3: Execute Tasks**

## EDUCATION

**Machine Learning Switch Up Program** — Interview Kickstart - 2025  
Exploratory Data Analysis, Supervised, Unsupervised & Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks, Agentic Frameworks

**B.A.Sc., Computer Engineering (Software Engineering Major)** — University of British Columbia - Vancouver, BC - 2019
```

**Step 4: Report Results**

✅ **Successfully added LazyPredict to the resume!**

**Change Made:**
- Added "LazyPredict" to the **Machine Learning** skills section
- Positioned it between "TPOT" and "Synthetic Data" for logical grouping with other automated ML tools
- Also corrected "Tsfresh" back to lowercase "tsfresh" for consistency

**Updated Skills Line:**
`• **Machine Learning:** EDA, Feature Engineering, Vector Databases, NLP, LLM, Time-Series, tsfresh, TPOT, LazyPredict, Synthetic Data.`

LazyPredict is now prominently featured in your ML skills, which demonstrates your experience with automated model comparison and selection - a valuable capability for rapid ML experimentation that aligns well with EA's need for "fast development and deployment of intelligent applications."

**Step 5: Repeat Cycle**

**Step 2: Formulate Plan**

The user wants to remove one item from the Machine Learning skills line to make room, asking which item is least valued in the industry. I need to:

1. Analyze the current Machine Learning skills line
2. Evaluate each skill's industry value and relevance to the EA role
3. Recommend which skill to remove based on industry standards and job requirements

**Step 3: Execute Tasks**

Current Machine Learning skills: `EDA, Feature Engineering, Vector Databases, NLP, LLM, Time-Series, tsfresh, TPOT, LazyPredict, Synthetic Data`

**Industry Value Analysis:**

**HIGH VALUE (Keep):**
- **NLP, LLM** - Core AI/ML skills, highly demanded
- **Vector Databases** - Critical for modern AI applications
- **Feature Engineering** - Fundamental ML skill
- **Time-Series** - Specialized, valuable skill
- **TPOT, LazyPredict** - AutoML tools, increasingly valuable

**MEDIUM VALUE:**
- **EDA** - Important but basic, expected skill
- **tsfresh** - Specialized time-series tool

**LOWER VALUE:**
- **Synthetic Data** - Niche application, less commonly used in practice

**Step 4: Report Results**

**Recommendation: Remove "Synthetic Data"**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Least Industry Demand** - Synthetic data generation is a niche skill with limited practical applications compared to other ML fundamentals
2. **Not EA-Specific** - EA's job description doesn't mention synthetic data needs
3. **Most Replaceable** - The other skills (NLP, LLM, Vector Databases, AutoML tools) are more core to modern ML workflows
4. **Academic vs Practical** - Synthetic data is more common in research settings than production environments

**Alternative considerations:**
- "EDA" could also be removed since it's considered a basic expectation rather than a differentiating skill
- However, "Synthetic Data" is more specialized/niche and less universally applicable

**Recommended action:** Remove "Synthetic Data" to make the skills line more focused on high-impact, industry-standard capabilities.

**Step 5: Repeat Cycle**

**Step 2: Formulate Plan**

Based on the transcript, I need to make multiple changes to the skills section:

1. Remove "Synthetic Data" from Machine Learning line
2. Remove all periods/full stops from the skills section
3. Change "Core Engineering" to "Core"
4. Change "Cloud Computing" to "Cloud"  
5. Change "Artificial Intelligence" to "AI"
6. Change "Machine Learning" to "ML"
7. Change "Integrations" to "APIs"

**Step 3: Execute Tasks**

Let me read the current file to see the exact content:

I see the file has been modified with additional SageMaker details. Let me make the changes one by one:
