# Resume Tool Research Project

## File Maintenance Rules
- **Minimum tokens**: Use fewest words without losing detail
- **Maximum accuracy**: No fabricated information  
- **Concise with full detail**: Complete information in compact format
- **Use tables & point forms**: Structure data for minimal tokens
- **Progress tracking**: Update status as research progresses
- **Follow these rules**: Apply consistently throughout file maintenance

## End Goal & Purpose
Automate creation of tailored single-page resumes for each job application. With extensive experience, need to selectively present relevant content per job description while maintaining professional quality and ATS compatibility. This tool will enable faster, more targeted job applications.

## Project Objective
Find the optimal solution for programmatic resume generation with maximum control and ATS compatibility to support automated, job-specific resume tailoring.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Generate professional single-page PDF resumes from structured data
- Job-specific content selection and tailoring automation
- ATS (Applicant Tracking System) optimization
- Template-based approach for multiple resume versions
- Customizable styling and layout control
- Searchable PDF output with proper text layers
- Selective experience/skills presentation based on job requirements

### Solution Types & Evaluation

| Type | Options | Criteria | Weight |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Python SDKs** | Native PDF, HTML/CSS converters, Template engines | ATS compatibility, Control level | High |
| **APIs** | Resume services, PDF APIs, Template services | Cost, Ease of use | Medium |
| **Alternatives** | LaTeX, Markdown to PDF, Cloud generators | Maintenance, Output quality | Low |

### Technical Requirements
- Python integration capability
- Batch processing support for multiple job applications
- Template reusability with content filtering logic
- Data separation from presentation
- Version control friendly (text-based templates)
- Single-page layout enforcement
- Job description parsing and content matching capabilities

## Solution Candidates

| Solution | Approach | ATS Score | Control | Complexity |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **WeasyPrint + Jinja2** | HTML/CSS templating | High | Medium | Low |
| **ReportLab** | Programmatic PDF | High | High | High |
| **API Services** | External service | TBD | Low | Low |

### Decision Factors
- Implementation complexity vs control trade-off
- Long-term maintenance requirements  
- ATS scan test results
- Template creation workflow efficiency

## Next Steps
1. Create working prototypes for top 2 Python solutions
2. Test ATS compatibility with online scanners
3. Evaluate API alternatives
4. Document final recommendation with implementation guide
