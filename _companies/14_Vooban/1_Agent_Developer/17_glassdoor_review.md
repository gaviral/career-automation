## Interview Process Description

Do not let recruiters use AI transcribers or any AI notetaker. The process lacked transparency; after an entire hour-long second interview, the recruiter disclosed that other candidates were already in final stages, creating false expectations and wasting significant time. An initial recruiter screen covered background, AI/LLM experience, and salary expectations. A technical question often followed. A subsequent in-depth behavioral and background interview with the same recruiter explored situational questions and past projects. This demonstrated poor internal coordination. It raised ethical concerns for a startup. Future candidates should directly inquire about pipeline status. Demand clear timelines. Be extremely wary of recruiter-heavy processes. Watch for red flags like conflicting information on candidate progression.

## Interview Difficulty

**Selected:** ⭐⭐ Easy

The interviews themselves were straightforward. Questions focused on past projects (especially Project Scott - my AI documentation agent at Amazon), comfort w/ startup environment, & standard behavioral scenarios. Technical question asked during recruiter screen was surface-level (context window degradation percentage).

**Rationale:** Not challenging technically; primarily conversational & behavioral in nature.
