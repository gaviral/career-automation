- Job specifically values medical device or regulated industry experience
- Resume shows no prior medical device company experience
- Mitigation: Project demonstrates deep understanding of medical device compliance requirements

**2. MEDIUM IMPACT - Years of Experience Gap**  
- Job requires 7+ years, resume shows 5+ years
- 2-year experience gap could be concerning for strict requirements
- Mitigation: High-quality experience at Amazon with leadership roles

**3. LOW IMPACT - Requirements Management Systems Experience**
