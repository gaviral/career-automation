- **Mentorship opportunities** - Learn from seniors, also teach juniors, two-way growth

**Why possible:** You're drawn to new tech (Scribd's new AWS stack, Cresta's cutting-edge agents). Your resume is metric-heavy. You're applying to mix of sizes (startups like Cresta, larger like EA). You led workshops (suggests enjoy teaching).

---

### Question 4: What's your risk tolerance for joining early-stage companies vs. established ones?
**Why high impact:** Your applications span startups (Cresta, Senpilot) to enterprises (EA, Amazon). Understanding risk tolerance helps prioritize which offers to pursue, especially given recent layoff and family situation.

**Suggested Answer 1 (Most Likely):**
- **Moderate risk tolerance** - Prefer growth-stage with product-market fit and real users (not pre-product), but not necessarily FAANG-size
- **Stability matters now** - Recent layoff + pregnant wife increase need for financial security, less willing to gamble on pre-seed
- **Mission can offset risk** - Would join smaller company if mission deeply resonates and technical match is perfect
- **Want 1-2 year runway minimum** - Company should have clear path to sustainability, not burn-and-churn

**Why likely:** You're interviewing at mix of sizes but all have real products/users (Scribd 250M docs, Kardium medical device). Recent layoff + family situation suggests stability is elevated priority. But you're not only applying to FAANG (mix of stages).

**Suggested Answer 2:**
- **Low risk tolerance currently** - Prioritize stability heavily due to family situation, prefer established companies with proven business models
- **Benefits package matters** - Health insurance, parental leave, stock value (not just equity on paper)
- **Brand name valuable** - Want recognizable company for resume (helpful for future job search if needed)
- **Avoid Series A or earlier** - Too much uncertainty, prefer Series B+ or public companies

**Why plausible:** Layoff + pregnant wife are significant life stressors. You're applying to EA (large), Amazon (former), Scribd (established). Risk-averse interpretation would be conservative choices now, take chances later.

**Suggested Answer 3:**
- **High risk tolerance** - Excited by early-stage chaos, willing to bet on mission and technical challenge
- **Equity upside important** - Want meaningful ownership, not just salary
- **Building from scratch appealing** - Greenfield work more exciting than maintaining legacy systems
- **Trust your abilities** - Confident you can find next job quickly if startup fails, layoff wasn't personal

**Why possible:** Your projects (Bob, Pre-bunker, FoodFlow) show entrepreneurial energy. You're applying to very young companies (Cresta). Layoff was team merger, not performance—might not have dented confidence. Some people become more risk-seeking after layoff ("nothing to lose").

---

### Question 5: What does success look like for you 2-3 years from now?
**Why high impact:** Understanding your medium-term vision helps identify roles that serve as stepping stones vs. destinations. Your current applications might be tactical (need job now) or strategic (build specific experience). Knowing the difference matters.

**Suggested Answer 1 (Most Likely):**
- **Technical leadership role** - Staff/Principal Engineer or Tech Lead at company working on cutting-edge AI/LLMs
- **Recognized LLM cost optimization expert** - Known in industry for efficiency work (your 40% reduction approach)
- **Stable family situation** - New baby thriving, work-life balance achieved, financial security restored
- **Continue building side projects** - Bob evolved, maybe productized, contributing to open source (Live Transcriber continuation)
- **Deeper AI/ML expertise** - Completed ML program, shipped multiple LLM systems, maybe speaking at conferences

**Why likely:** Your cost optimization work is unique differentiator. You're in ML program and building projects constantly (learning-oriented). Family is priority (pregnant wife). You already have PyPI package with 7.8K downloads (suggests interest in broader impact).

**Suggested Answer 2:**
- **Startup co-founder or early engineer** - Built something meaningful from scratch, either your own venture or joining as engineer #1-5
- **Multiple successful AI products shipped** - Portfolio of deployed systems serving real users at scale
- **Financial independence progress** - Equity vested, salary saved, less dependent on W-2 income
- **Teaching and mentorship** - Formal role mentoring engineers, maybe adjunct teaching, expanded documentation work
- **Work-life integration** - Flexible schedule, remote-first, more control over time

**Suggested Answer 3:**
- **Management track** - Engineering Manager leading team, people leadership, strategic decision-making
- **Switched to full-time AI research** - More academic/research-oriented, less production engineering
- **Same role, better company** - Happy doing similar Backend + Data + ML work but at dream company (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **Industry pivot** - Moved to specific domain you're passionate about (healthcare AI, education tech)
- **Consultant or fractional engineer** - Multiple part-time engagements, portfolio career, max flexibility

**Why possible:** You led team of 8 at Amazon (management experience). In ML program (could pivot to research). Healthcare (Kardium) and knowledge (Scribd) interest might indicate domain passion. Family situation could drive consulting flexibility.

---

### Question 6: How important is it that your work has direct, visible impact on end users?
**Why high impact:** Some engineers thrive on user-facing impact, others prefer infrastructure work behind the scenes. Your resume emphasizes scale (40M users) and metrics (82% improvement), but is that about users or technical achievement?

**Suggested Answer 1 (Most Likely):**
- **Very important** - Want to see how your work affects real people, not just internal tools or abstract systems
- **Mission-driven motivation** - "Democratize knowledge" (Scribd) and "patient safety" (Kardium) resonate because they're tangible human benefits
- **Metrics that matter** - 40M users, 240+ dev-hrs saved—these numbers represent real people helped
- **But infrastructure is fine** - As long as there's clear connection to user value (data pipelines power recommendations for millions)

**Why likely:** Your resume leads with user impact (40M customers, 15+ countries). You're excited about Scribd's mission and Kardium's patient safety. Even internal tools (Project Scott) you frame as helping teammates. Your applications are all to companies with real users, not pure B2B infra.

**Suggested Answer 2:**
- **Moderately important** - Care more about technical challenge and scale than specific user facing
- **Impact can be indirect** - Building platforms that enable others to build user-facing features (AWS-style)
- **Metrics for credibility** - User numbers are valuable for resume/interviews, but not primary motivation
- **Engineer's engineer** - Respect from technical peers matters more than end-user recognition

**Why plausible:** Your deep technical work (40TB/day pipelines, distributed systems) is more infrastructure than user-facing. You're applying to ML platform roles (Scribd's 2026 vision is platform for internal teams). Your satisfaction might come from technical excellence, users are just scale proof.

**Suggested Answer 3:**
- **Less important** - Technical challenge and learning are primary drivers, user impact is secondary
- **Research-oriented** - Would be happy in ML research role with no immediate user deployment
- **Open source appeal** - Live Transcriber (7.8K downloads) shows interest in dev tooling, not end-user products
- **B2B is fine** - Don't need consumer-facing work, enterprise tools equally satisfying

**Why possible:** Live Transcriber is dev tool (no end users). Project Scott was internal documentation agent (helping devs). Your ML program coursework suggests interest in the science itself. Some of your applications are to B2B companies.

---

### Question 7: What's your preferred balance between breadth (learning new things) and depth (mastering existing skills)?
**Why high impact:** Understanding this helps identify roles that will keep you engaged. Your projects show both breadth (many frameworks) and depth (cost optimization mastery). Which energizes you more?

**Suggested Answer 1 (Most Likely):**
- **60% breadth, 40% depth** - Love learning new technologies (LangChain, CrewAI, Agent Kit, Autogen) but also go deep on key areas (LLM cost optimization)
- **T-shaped engineer** - Broad awareness of AI/ML landscape, deep expertise in specific areas (Backend + Data + LLMs intersection)
- **Context-dependent** - Early in career was more breadth, now seeking depth in LLM/agent systems (your niche)
- **Learning through building** - Pick up new frameworks by building projects (FoodFlow used 4 agent frameworks), not just reading docs

**Why likely:** Your 2025 projects use diverse tech (LangChain, CrewAI, Agent Kit, Autogen, Plotly, D3, Matplotlib) but all center on AI agents (depth theme). ML program enrollment suggests want to deepen ML theory. You're not jumping industries (staying Backend + Data + AI)—depth within breadth.

**Suggested Answer 2:**
- **40% breadth, 60% depth** - Prefer going deep on specific technologies/domains, become the expert
- **Mastery-driven** - Want to be THE person for LLM cost optimization, distributed data pipelines, RAG systems
- **Specialization path** - Intentionally narrowing focus to AI agent development (Vooban, Cresta applications)
- **Deep over wide** - Would rather master AWS CDK completely than dabble in 10 IaC tools

**Why plausible:** Your cost optimization work is deep expertise (40% reduction is significant). Your systematic prep guides show depth of analysis. You're pursuing agent-specific roles, not generic SWE. "Work backward from problem" suggests you go deep to understand root causes.

**Suggested Answer 3:**
- **70% breadth, 30% depth** - Generalist energy, love trying new frameworks, easily bored by repetition
- **ADHD-driven curiosity** - New challenges keep you engaged, deep mastery can feel constraining
- **Polyglot engineer** - Python, Node, React, TypeScript, Kotlin, C#—breadth is a feature
- **Startup-friendly** - Wear many hats, pick up whatever's needed, not precious about specialization

**Why possible:** Your project list is very diverse (AR/VR, chatbots, data pipelines, agents, web apps). ADHD often correlates with novelty-seeking. You've worked in multiple domains (e-commerce, beauty, AI, AR/VR). Applying to varied roles (Build Engineer, AI Agent, Backend+Data).

---

### Question 8: What role does compensation (salary + equity) play in your decision-making?
**Why high impact:** Recent layoff + pregnant wife changes financial context. Understanding whether you'd take lower pay for better mission/tech fit helps prioritize which offers to negotiate hard on vs. accept quickly.

**Suggested Answer 1 (Most Likely):**
- **Important but not primary driver** - Need to hit minimum threshold for family security (~$120K+ CAD?), but beyond that, mission and technical fit matter more
- **Total comp matters** - Salary + equity + benefits (parental leave, health insurance) all factored together
- **Market rate expected** - Want fair compensation for 8+ years experience and rare skill combo (Backend + Data + AI), but not chasing max TC
- **Negotiation willing** - Would negotiate for better offer but not walk away from perfect role for 10-20% more elsewhere

**Why likely:** You're strategic but not mercenary (chose Kardium Build Engineer over Software Developer despite lower salary because better fit). Family situation increases baseline need but you're also mission-driven (excited about Scribd/Kardium missions). Your applications aren't only FAANG (which pay most).

**Suggested Answer 2:**
- **Very important currently** - Financial security is elevated priority post-layoff, need to maximize earnings to rebuild savings
- **Top of range targeted** - Want $135K+ for Kardium Build Engineer, $150K+ for Scribd-level roles
- **Equity significant** - Could be life-changing for family, want meaningful ownership
- **Would prioritize comp over mission** - If two offers similar technically, would choose higher-paying one

**Why plausible:** Layoff + pregnant wife are major financial stressors. You mention targeting top of range ($135K+) for Kardium. Rebuilding financial security after job loss is common priority. Vancouver COL is high. Equity could offset layoff impact.

**Suggested Answer 3:**
- **Secondary consideration** - As long as baseline met, technical challenge and mission far more important
- **Would take pay cut for right role** - Ideal mission + perfect technical fit + great culture worth $10-20K less
- **Non-monetary factors prioritized** - Flexibility, learning opportunities, work-life balance more valuable than marginal salary increases
- **Long-term thinking** - Right role builds skills worth more in 2-3 years than immediate salary maximization

**Why possible:** Your systematic prep suggests you think long-term (probability calculations, strategic fit). You value learning (enrolled in ML program during gap). Some people become less money-focused after layoff (prioritize happiness). Your side projects suggest passion over profit.

---

### Question 9: How do you want to spend your first 90 days at your next role?
**Why high impact:** Understanding your onboarding preferences reveals what you value (ship quickly vs. learn deeply, independence vs. guidance). This can help assess whether a company's onboarding approach will frustrate or energize you.

**Suggested Answer 1 (Most Likely):**
- **Weeks 1-4: Deep learning** - Understand the codebase, architecture, data flows, team dynamics; pair with teammates; read all the docs
- **Weeks 5-8: Incremental contributions** - Ship small, well-scoped features; build credibility; demonstrate coding standards fit
- **Weeks 9-12: Meaningful impact** - Take on medium-sized project solo; apply LLM/optimization insights; identify improvement opportunities
- **Throughout: Build relationships** - 1-on-1s with cross-functional partners, understand how teams collaborate

**Why likely:** Your documentation obsession and systematic prep suggest you'd value thorough onboarding. Amazon's rigor likely set expectations for understanding systems deeply. You led teams (relationship building). Your cost optimization work came from understanding systems holistically.

**Suggested Answer 2:**
- **Immediate impact focus** - Ship something visible in first 2 weeks; earn team's trust through action
- **Learn by doing** - Dive into codebase by fixing bugs, don't need extensive onboarding
- **Autonomous from day 1** - Prefer minimal hand-holding, figure things out yourself
- **Prove technical chops quickly** - Demonstrate your 8+ years experience immediately, establish credibility

**Why plausible:** "Work backward from problem" suggests comfort with ambiguity. Your layoff might create urgency to prove value quickly. Some senior engineers prefer diving in over structured onboarding. Your side projects show you can figure things out independently.

**Suggested Answer 3:**
- **Relationship-heavy start** - Spend first month mostly on 1-on-1s, understanding team culture and dynamics
- **Research before building** - Weeks 1-8 understanding user needs, data patterns, pain points; weeks 9-12 proposing solutions
- **Documentation contribution** - Use onboarding to improve docs (if gaps), establish documentation culture from day 1
- **Strategic visibility** - Identify high-impact opportunity early, propose it in first month, execute in months 2-3

**Why possible:** You led documentation workshops (could repeat at new company). Your strategic thinking (Kardium analysis) suggests you'd want to understand before acting. Building relationships important (cross-functional collaboration strength). Alisa's tips emphasize working with tech + non-tech people.

### Question 10: If you could design your perfect workday schedule, what would it look like?
**Why high impact:** Understanding your ideal rhythm reveals energy patterns, collaboration preferences, and work-life balance needs. ADHD context suggests this is particularly important for sustained performance.

**Suggested Answer 1 (Most Likely):**
- **Flexible start (9-10 AM)** - Not a morning person, or need time for family/foundation routine
- **Focus blocks (2-3 hours deep work)** - Ideally 10 AM-1 PM for coding/architecture, minimal meetings
- **Async-heavy communication** - Slack/docs preferred over meetings, can respond when energy permits
- **Break for movement/food** - Mid-day reset critical for ADHD, not desk-chained for 8 hours straight
- **Afternoon for collaboration** - 2-4 PM for meetings, pair programming, reviews; easier to context-switch then
- **Flexible end time** - Some days finish early, some days evening focus block if in flow
- **Hybrid/remote** - Mostly remote (deep work), occasional office for collaboration/social

**Why likely:** ADHD often means energy fluctuates, need flexibility. Family (pregnant wife) might require flexible schedule. Your systematic prep suggests you'd structure your day intentionally. Remote work in prep materials. Documentation preference suggests async-friendly.

**Suggested Answer 2:**
- **Early start (7-8 AM)** - Most productive in morning, get deep work done before meetings
- **Meeting-light mornings** - Protect 8 AM-12 PM for focus work
- **Structured routine** - Same schedule daily, predictability helps ADHD management
- **End by 5 PM** - Clear work-life boundary, family time non-negotiable
- **In-office 2-3 days/week** - Social energy from coworkers, but need quiet days at home too

**Why plausible:** Some people with ADHD thrive on rigid structure (prevents drift). Early start might work if family routines support it. Amazon likely had structured hours. Clear boundaries important with new baby coming.

**Suggested Answer 3:**
- **Night owl schedule** - Most creative 8 PM-2 AM, prefer company that allows flexible hours
- **Maker schedule** - Full-day focus blocks (Paul Graham essay), avoid meetings entirely if possible
- **Fully remote/async** - Minimal real-time collaboration, work whenever inspired
- **Burst work pattern** - Intense work sprints followed by rest days, not steady 8 hours daily

**Why possible:** Some ADHD people are night owls. Your side projects (built during unemployment) might have been on own schedule. Async preference appears in prep materials. But less likely given family situation (pregnant wife probably needs consistent schedule).
