Examine all the changes that have happened so far since the last commit, and then commit and push with the best conventional commit message with all the what, why, how, results, and all of those sections you think would be useful? 
Make sure to not make anything up.Keep everything factual.
Also make sure to not lose a single shot of detail.
Do this in multiple commits, if needed, such that every single commit is following the single responsibility principle.
