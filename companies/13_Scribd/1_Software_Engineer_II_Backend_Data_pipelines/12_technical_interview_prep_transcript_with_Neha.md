**Neha:** Hello?

**Aviral:** Hi, Neha. How are you doing?

**Neha:** I am good. Are you?

**Aviral:** Doing very good. I'm excited about the next steps.

**Neha:** Wonder why does your name say Alex?

**Aviral:** Oh, does it say Alex? Yeah. Oh, that's weird. Oh, I logged in from, like, in one of my Google accounts that are, like, kind of, like, I stay anonymous. With that.

**Neha:** Oh. Yeah. My bad. Am I having am I talking to some other candidate? Or, like, have got confused with, like, who am I speaking to?

**Aviral:** My bad. Like, yeah, I was just like, yeah. Like, this is just like, for me to say, well, I guess not anonymous anymore.

**Neha:** Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No. I mean, I think we have got a great feedback with your last chat with Sachin, excited about the technical screening round, and I want to give you insight on what to expect. Mhmm. But, yeah, mean, before that, how was your with Sachin? Like, did you get a chance to ask questions?

**Aviral:** I did, I there it was very insightful, and I got to learn, like, quite a bit from him. So, yeah, like, it was very interesting chat and learned about the different projects that Sachin, like, and his team is dealing with. So that was that was very insightful.

**Neha:** Perfect. And in the in the next conversation, this is mostly a coding round, a deck a, like, a technical screening round, actually, with one of the senior engineers. His name is Harry. Mhmm. He's also part of same team, and, yeah, they would like to understand more about, like, the problem solving skills, critical thinking. So my general guidance for that session would be which I just give to every candidate is go through the technical problem with the interviewer, clarifying questions in advance, state your assumption, discuss your thought process, The more you are, the more you will interact with the interviewer the more understanding you will get about the problem. And then based on that, you can proceed.

**Aviral:** Right.

**Neha:** Second thing would be, I think it's not just only a technical solution which they would be evaluating, but also, like, what's the collaborative style? What's the like, how much room player a candidate is? What are the have they been asking? And based on that, also, they will depict the level. Lastly, make sure you have your interesting questions ready for Harry. He can give you very good insight on whatever questions you may have or whatever is top of your mind is. And in terms of some of the prep for this session, it will consist of two parts. I've also shared this snippet with you on the chat. The first part would be more around writing, like, a system schema designing and writing a SQL query, and the second part would be, like, writing a pseudo code. For a very straightforward problem. So I mean, a mix of system design and a technical screening portion. Based on yeah, based on data structure and algorithm, I can say, we we use Coderpad in this platform. So that's the platform that we use for any coding assessments.

**Aviral:** Okay. Okay. I see. Just give me one moment. Like, just gonna finish writing. Yeah. Like, I'm just taking notes as we go. I hope that's okay.

**Neha:** That's fine. Yes. Yeah. Hopefully.

**Aviral:** For the schema design, like, for the SQL queries, like, I'm I'm assuming, like, it's, like, somewhat, like, easy, moderate, hard difficulty. Is that I'm I'm, like, I'm just wondering also, like, what what would be good place for because it's a whole wide world where, like, different kinds of questions can be asked. I'm wondering if LeadCode is a good place for preparation just to get a, like, basic sense of idea of what kind of questions to expect.

**Neha:** Yeah. It could be, like, very, very broad, I would say. Say, like, some of the ML based system design, maybe, like, where, let's say, we have a very simple public document hosting website and the main page has a list of documents. So how would someone can work on exercise to asserting the database schema, like, sitting on a document brings a user to a document base. So we would like to build category. We would like to kind of, like, have a search or ranking section. I'm not too sure how much it would be, but it something along those lines as broad the problem could be.

**Aviral:** Right. Right. I see. Okay. Let me actually put notes on my this here itself.

**Neha:** Yeah. I think something most, you know, goes lines.

**Aviral:** Yep. Sorry. I'm just yeah. Like, I I just switched to writing notes on my computer itself.

**Neha:** Yeah. Mhmm. Yeah. Give me just one moment.

**Aviral:** Okay. So, yeah, like, what I'm hearing is, like, a broad, like, system design, broad like, the the like, also the data structures and algorithms you mentioned. And then the SQL. So these are the main main big things.

**Neha:** Yeah. Yeah. Followed by fifteen minutes of a discussion how to build a data pipeline or system to productionize it.

**Aviral:** Perfect. Mostly as team what I've just mentioned. Okay. Okay. I see. Oh, I see that you sent the that here itself. Sorry. I did not notice that earlier.

**Neha:** No. That's okay. You can copy paste that if needed.

**Aviral:** Yeah. I mean, so I would say, like, it's a it's a very like, a straightforward screening, like a text screening round. And if that goes well, then we proceed to the next steps.

**Aviral:** Perfect. So what would the next steps look like?

**Neha:** Yeah. If this one goes well, then we have two technical loops consisting of our coding and our system design. And before that, we will again do a prep call so I can give you insight on who you'd be meeting and what that would entail. But that's kind of, like, the structure of it.

**Aviral:** Right. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I think that does give me a lot of insights for sure. I mean, if I have any more questions, of course, I think like, I should have enough. But if I have any more questions, I'll surely like, I hope that's okay if—

**Neha:** Yes. If I bother you about it. Reach out. Yeah. Yeah. It's okay.

**Aviral:** Perfect. Is there anything else I should be knowing about the next design? I think I do have a good sense of what what's to come.

**Neha:** Yeah. No. I think that's pretty much from my end. Make sure you have your ready for Harry and Bill for Kopama on the feedback.

**Aviral:** Right. Yeah. The interviewers you mentioned, like, could you also send me, like, a little bit of, like, profile about them just so that I know my audience?

**Neha:** Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Let me I will just send you the name. Although Tammy would be sending you the full details as well. But—

**Aviral:** Perfect. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. At the end, may I know his, like, position in the company, like, as in what does he do? It's just—

**Neha:** He's a mid level engineer on Sachin's team. Yeah. So maybe to senior level engineer, I would say.

**Aviral:** Okay. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Awesome. Well, thank you so much, Neha. I appreciate it. I'd appreciate all the information. I do not have any questions right now, but I I think I have enough information to move forward.

**Neha:** Okay. Alright. Good luck to you. I will circle back a little once we get the feedback. And we'll proceed from there.

**Aviral:** Perfect. Sounds good. I look forward to it.

**Neha:** Yeah. Thank you. Take care. Bye.

# What she sent in the chat

You will be working through a real-life problem that you’ll encounter on the job. The first part of the interview will be to update an existing schema design, and write a SQL. The second part will be to write pseudo code for a straightforward problem, followed up by discussion on how to productionize the solution.

Two parts:
Part 1: Schema design + write SQL
Part 2: Write pseudo-code for a common use-case that the team works on, followed by 15 minutes of discussion on how to build a data pipeline or system to productionize it
