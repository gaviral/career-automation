# FINAL ANSWERS - Project Scott Adjusted
**Based on:** Mehul's feedback + Project Scott truthfulness adjustment

**Interview:** Oct 9, 2025, 1PM PDT  
**Interviewers:** Daniel (Hiring Mgr), Blaze (Director), Rhea (Tech Director)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: PROJECT STRATEGY ADJUSTMENT

### Primary Story: VTO PROJECT (100% TRUE, FULLY VERIFIABLE)
- Use this as main project walkthrough
- All details verified and true
- Strong technical depth
- Shows technical artist collaboration (Tyler asked for this)

### Secondary Story: PROJECT SCOTT (PROTOTYPE + WORKSHOP)
- **Workshop is 100% TRUE:** Led org-wide documentation workshop, created SME reference table, reached 100% documentation completion
- **AI Agent was a PROTOTYPE:** Built and tested, not fully deployed across Beauty Tech
- **Metrics were PROJECTED:** 82% improvement and 240 hrs/month were extrapolations/projections, not measured results

### If Asked About Project Scott:
**Focus on what's 100% true:**
1. **The workshop** (led org-wide initiative, 100% doc completion)
2. **The prototype** (built AI agent as proof of concept)
3. **The projected impact** (extrapolated 240 hrs/month savings)

**Avoid saying:**
- ‚ùå "Deployed across organization"
- ‚ùå "Achieved 82% improvement" (use "projected")
- ‚ùå "Saved 240 hours" (use "projected to save")

**Do say:**
- ‚úÖ "Built a prototype AI agent"
- ‚úÖ "Led documentation workshop that achieved 100% completion"
- ‚úÖ "When we extrapolated the impact, projected 240+ hrs/month savings"

## üé® Q2: "WALK ME THROUGH A PROJECT" (1-1.5 min - USE VTO)

**Tyler's Note:** Use VTO to show technical artists collaboration. This is 100% TRUE and verifiable.

**Memory Triggers:** VTO ‚Üí AR lipstick try-on ‚Üí Replace tool, bad photos ‚Üí Event-driven, SageMaker ‚Üí 6 teams (TECHNICAL ARTISTS first) ‚Üí Challenges + Learnings

**Full Answer:**

*I'll walk you through the* **Visual Property Extraction pipeline** *for* **AR virtual try-on** *at* **Amazon Beauty Tech**.

**The Context:** *On the Amazon app, when you go to a lipstick product and want to see what it would look like on you, you can click* **virtual try-on**‚Äî*the camera opens, face tracking happens, and you can try different lipsticks in* **real-time AR**. *For this to work, you need* **face tracking**, **3D lip models**, *and most importantly,* **accurate color and visual properties** *of the product*.

**My Project:** *I led the* **visual property extraction pipeline**‚Äî*extracting* **color (RGB values)**, **finish type** *(matte vs shiny)*, **particle properties** *(glitter size, shimmer)*‚Äî*and sending that to the next team who created* **3D models** *and did the* **AR rendering**.

**Problem:** *We needed to* **replace a costly third-party tool**, *and* **beauty brands** *were submitting* **non-standard product photos**‚Äî*wildly different lighting, angles, backgrounds. Some said "unicorn red" instead of proper color data. We needed* **RGB values** *and* **standardized properties**.

**My Role:** **Technical lead** *for the* **end-to-end pipeline**. *I owned* **architecture, planning, execution**, *consulting a senior engineer for design review*.

**Architecture:** **Event-driven pipeline**‚Äî**Step Functions + Lambda** *triggered by product catalog changes*, **SageMaker Ground Truth** *for* **data labeling** *(bounding boxes, color extraction)*, **API Gateway + Lambda** *orchestration*, **DynamoDB** *for state*, **S3** *for artifacts*, **AWS CDK + CloudFormation** *for Infrastructure as Code*, **4-staged CI/CD**, **CloudWatch + X-Ray** *for observability*.

**Collaboration‚ÄîThis is the Key Part:**

*I coordinated across* **6 different teams**:

1. **Technical artists on the rendering team**‚Äî*Regular syncs on* **visual calibration** *and* **color accuracy** *for AR. We ran* **double-blind experiments** *with people of different genders and races to validate that our* **RGB values** *looked realistic on different* **skin tones** *in AR*.

2. **Designers**‚Äî*UX collaboration, visual property standards*

3. **Data scientists**‚Äî*Model training for bounding boxes and color extraction*

4. **Product managers**‚Äî*Requirements gathering, working backward from product vision*

5. **External 3D asset creation team**‚Äî*Guided overall direction while respecting their expertise*

6. **Beauty brand bridge teams**‚Äî*Guided standardization of photo submissions*

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **Replaced the third-party tool**
- ‚úÖ **Established org-wide standards** *for future beauty brand partners*
- ‚úÖ **High data quality** *validated through our user experiments*
- ‚úÖ *This fed into the larger* **Beauty Tech data lake** *processing* **40TB/day**

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Non-standard inputs:** *Product catalog had* **wildly inconsistent data**‚Äî*"unicorn red", "sunset pink". We needed* **RGB values** *and* **standardized properties** *(matte vs shiny, particle size for glitter)*.

2. **Cross-team alignment:** *Six different teams with* **different priorities**‚Äî*beauty brands wanted fast onboarding, data scientists needed high-quality training data*.

3. **Scale:** *Had to process the* **entire Amazon Beauty catalog**‚Äî*millions of products, varying image quality*.

**How I Solved Them:**

1. **Worked backward from the problem:** *Instead of just building better extraction algorithms, I worked with* **beauty brand bridge teams** *to* **improve photo submission standards** *at the source*. *Created* **standardized forms** *and* **naming conventions**.

2. **Data-driven alignment:** *Brought* **experimental results** *to team meetings‚Äîshowed that* **low-quality photos = poor AR realism = customer churn**. *This helped teams prioritize quality over speed*.

3. **Phased approach:** **Phase 1** *accepted current submissions with manual review,* **Phase 2** *improved standards,* **Phase 3** *full automation*. *This balanced urgency with quality*.

**Key Learning:**

*The biggest learning was* **don't just solve the immediate technical problem‚Äîwork backward to address root causes**. *In this case, that meant* **improving the data at the source** *(photo submissions)* *rather than only building better extraction algorithms*. *This approach created* **lasting organizational impact** *(standards adopted for future partners)* *rather than just a one-time technical fix*.

**[STOP. Offer: "I can go deeper into technical architecture, the cross-team collaboration dynamics, or any of these challenges‚Äîwhat would be most useful?"]**

## üéÆ Q3: "TELL ME ABOUT WORKING WITH TECHNICAL ARTISTS" (Tyler specifically asked)

**Memory Triggers:** Rendering team ‚Üí Visual calibration ‚Üí RGB values, skin tones ‚Üí Double-blind experiments ‚Üí Data-driven ‚Üí UBC game dev

**Full Answer:**

*I have two strong examples.*

**Amazon Beauty Tech‚ÄîVTO Project:**

*On the VTO project, I worked closely with* **technical artists** *on the* **rendering team**. *Their focus was* **real-time AR rendering** *and* **face tracking**.

**The Challenge:** *Ensuring that the* **color values** *we extracted from product images* **looked realistic** *when rendered on* **different skin tones in AR**.

**My Approach:**
- *Scheduled* **regular syncs** *specifically for* **visual calibration** *discussions*
- *Conducted* **data-driven experiments**‚Äî**double-blind tests** *with people of different* **genders and races** *wearing virtual lipsticks in our demo app*
- *This gave us* **real data** *to align on what "realistic" meant* **technically vs artistically**
- *I brought* **experimental results** *to our discussions rather than just talking about RGB values*
- *Respected their* **expertise** *in visual rendering‚Äîthey understood realism, I ensured our pipeline delivered the right data*

**Result:** *We achieved* **color accuracy standards** *that balanced* **technical precision** *with* **visual realism**, *validated through our user testing*.

**UBC Game Development Capstone:**

*At University of British Columbia, I led a* **game development capstone** *where I was* **technical lead** *and* **bridge** *between* **engineers and game designers/artists**.

**Key Learning:** *We speak* **different languages**‚Äî*designers care about* **player experience** *and* **aesthetics**, *engineers care about* **frame rates** *and* **memory**. *I became the* **translator**, *ensuring* **design visions** *were technically feasible and technical constraints were understood creatively*.

**Why This Matters for EA:**

*I genuinely* **enjoy** *this type of collaboration*. *It's challenging but rewarding to* **bridge technical and creative worlds**, *and I know from Tyler that this is a* **big part of this role**.

**[STOP. Wait for follow-up.]**

## üöÄ Q4: PROJECT SCOTT (ONLY IF ASKED - Use with Caution)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Strategy:** Focus on WORKSHOP (100% true) + PROTOTYPE (true) + PROJECTED impact

**Memory Triggers:** Workshop 100% docs ‚Üí Prototype AI agent ‚Üí Projected 240 hrs ‚Üí SME reference table

**Full Answer (If Pressed):**

*I led an* **org-wide documentation initiative** *at Amazon Beauty Tech that* **achieved 100% documentation completion** *for our entire team*.

**The Workshop (100% TRUE):**
- *Hosted an* **organization-wide documentation workshop**
- *Created a* **subject matter expert reference table** *(mapped topics to experts)*
- *Assigned ownership to team members with* **review deadlines**
- *Everyone took ownership and we reached* **100% documentation completion**

**The Prototype (TRUE):**
- *As part of this initiative, I built a* **prototype AI agent** *called* **"Project Scott"**
- *It was a* **RAG-based system**‚Äî**vector embeddings + document retrieval + LLM Q&A**
- *Integrated with* **SageMaker** *for model hosting,* **Lambda + API Gateway** *for orchestration,* **DynamoDB** *for session state*
- *The idea: new engineers could ask* **CI/CD and admin questions**, *and it would search our documentation*
- *If it didn't find a match, it would* **refer to the SME reference table** *and suggest who to contact*

**The Impact (PROJECTED):**
- *When we extrapolated the potential impact based on initial testing, we* **projected 240+ dev-hours/month** *could be saved across the organization*
- *We saw early indicators of an* **82% improvement** *in question resolution time during prototype testing*

## üíº BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS

### "Describe receiving difficult feedback"

**Memory Triggers:** VTO architecture review ‚Üí Senior engineer ‚Üí Won't scale ‚Üí Felt defensive ‚Üí Redesigned ‚Üí 40TB scale ‚Üí Now proactive

**Answer:**

**Situation:** *Early in the VTO project, I proposed my initial architecture to a* **senior engineer** *for review*.

**Feedback:** *He said,* **"This won't scale beyond small volume. Your Step Functions orchestration will timeout with large batches. You need to rethink data partitioning and parallel processing."**

**Initial Reaction:** *I felt defensive‚ÄîI'd spent* **3 days** *on that design*. *But I took a step back.*

**Action:**
- *Scheduled a* **follow-up meeting** *to understand his concerns deeply*
- *Asked clarifying questions about* **expected scale**‚Äî*turned out it was* **10x** *what I'd designed for*
- *Acknowledged the gaps in my assumptions*
- **Redesigned** *with* **parallel processing**, *optimized* **Lambda memory allocation**, *implemented* **DynamoDB caching**

**Result:**
- *The final architecture* **scaled to 40TB/day** *serving* **40M+ users**
- **Strengthened my relationship** *with the senior engineer*
- *Now I* **proactively seek architecture reviews** *before full implementation*

**Learning:** **Feedback is a gift**. *Senior engineers have* **context I don't**. *Now I always ask upfront:* **"What scale should this handle?"**

### "Handling competing priorities from different teams"

**Memory Triggers:** Beauty brands vs data scientists ‚Üí Fast onboarding vs quality data ‚Üí Brought data showing impact ‚Üí Phased approach ‚Üí Both bought in

**Answer:**

**Situation:** *On the VTO project,* **beauty brand bridge teams** *wanted* **faster onboarding** *(pressure from executives)*, *but* **data scientists** *needed* **higher quality training data** *(couldn't train good models without it)*.

**Conflict:**
- *Bridge teams wanted to* **accept any photo submissions** *to speed onboarding*
- *Data scientists wanted* **strict photo standards** *to ensure model accuracy*

**My Approach:**
- *Facilitated a meeting with both teams to* **align on priorities**
- *Brought* **data**: *Showed experimental results proving* **low-quality photos = poor AR realism = bad customer experience = churn**
- *Proposed a* **phased approach**:
  - **Phase 1:** *Accept current submissions, manual review bottleneck*
  - **Phase 2:** *Work with beauty brands to improve submission standards*
  - **Phase 3:** *Automated pipeline with high-quality inputs*

**Communication:**
- **Regular status updates** *to both teams*
- **Documented decisions** *and trade-offs*
- **Managed expectations** *on timelines*

**Result:**
- *Both teams bought in*
- **Photo standards** *established that beauty brands adopted*
- **Data quality improved** *over time*
- *No compromise on* **customer experience**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS

### DON'T RAMBLE:
- ‚ùå **Recruiter screen:** Spent **2+ minutes** on Project Scott when **30-45 seconds** would work
- ‚úÖ **Fix:** Answer in **30-60 seconds** (Mehul approved 1-1.5 min for project walkthrough), THEN offer to elaborate
- ‚úÖ **Phrase:** *"I can go deeper into [X, Y, or Z]‚Äîwhat would be most useful?"*

### WATCH INTERVIEWER CUES:
- *If they say* **"Great"** or **"Perfect"** ‚Üí **STOP TALKING IMMEDIATELY**
- *If they're* **taking notes** ‚Üí **PAUSE** *to let them catch up*
- *If they say* **"That's exactly what I was looking for"** ‚Üí **MOVE ON**

### MEHUL'S TIPS:
- **Single-word triggers**, not reading scripts
- **Mention keywords**, let them probe

- **Focus on VTO** (100% true, verifiable, strong story)
- **Use "projected" for Project Scott metrics**

### PROJECT SCOTT HANDLING:
- ‚ùå **Don't volunteer it** as main project
- ‚úÖ **If asked:** Focus on **workshop** (100% true) + **prototype** (true) + **"projected"** impact
- ‚úÖ **Emphasis:** "Led org-wide documentation workshop, built prototype AI agent, projected 240 hrs/month savings"
- ‚úÖ **Interviewers have resume pulled up** - they'll see the bullet point but won't remember recruiter notes

### TYLER'S SPECIFIC EMPHASIS:
1. ‚úÖ **Cross-functional collaboration** (mentioned MULTIPLE times) - VTO has 6 teams
2. ‚úÖ **Technical artists & game devs** ("certainly a plus") - VTO rendering team collaboration
3. ‚úÖ **Communication** (emphasized multiple times) - VTO shows this extensively
4. ‚úÖ **AWS cloud-native full-stack** (core requirement) - Both projects demonstrate this
