Hi Tyler,

Thanks again for confirming we're moving forward – I'm excited about the next steps.

I received Naomi's scheduling invite and will submit my availability shortly. Before I do, I wanted to reach out with a quick question if you have a moment:

During my interview, Daniel mentioned the second round would be more technical – covering coding skills (split roughly 50% AI/ML and 50% general programming) with potential architecture questions. I'm keen to prepare effectively. Would you be able to clarify a few details:

1. **Interview Structure:** Any specific breakdown of time (e.g., how much coding vs. design discussion)?
2. **Coding Focus:** Should I prepare for algorithmic depth (data structures, optimization) or more practical implementation patterns?
3. **ML vs. General CS Balance:** Should I lean more toward ML system design (pipelines, model serving) or cloud application architecture?
4. **Technical Difficulty:** Any sense of the difficulty level I should target in my prep?

I want to come as prepared as possible while respecting your time. Thanks so much!

Best,

Aviral
