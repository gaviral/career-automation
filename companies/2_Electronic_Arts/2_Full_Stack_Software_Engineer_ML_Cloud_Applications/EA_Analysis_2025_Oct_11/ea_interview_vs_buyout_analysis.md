**Artist Access**:
- Team small enough for direct observation
- "Artists sit right behind me" (Blaze)
- Very collaborative Vancouver space
- Sister studios also use tools

### Advice for Starting (All 3 Interviewers)

**Daniel**: "Don't be shy. Ask everyone in all directions. Find right people and resources. Many teams working on related tech. EA-wide AI resources and products for experimentation. Company exploring third-party vs in-house solutions. **Initial phase: explore everything to build map of available resources, then design based on that.**"

**Rhea**: "Same as Daniel but bigger scale - cross-studio, cross-teams, completely different wings. Bit intimidating but fun. People usually willing to share, especially if excited about work."

**Your reflection (Aviral)**: "Sounds like subject matter expert mapping initiative from Amazon. Right up alley: create from scratch, know resources, leverage appropriately, time-box exploration, work backward from pain points, create pipelines/processes while maintaining scalability/extensibility."

## Part 2: Buyout Reality (From Web Search)

### The $55 Billion Deal

**Buyers**: Silver Lake (private equity) + Saudi Arabia's PIF + Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners

**Financing**: $20 billion loan (one of largest leveraged buyouts on record)

**Pressure**: Investors "heavily relying on AI to significantly reduce operating costs and manage substantial debt"

**Strategy**: "Betting that AI-powered cost-saving measures will substantially boost EA's profits"

**Concerns**: 
- Potential layoffs
- Impact on game quality & creativity
- Parallels to other large buyouts → aggressive cost-cutting
- Community & employee anxiety

### EA's Pre-Existing AI Work (CEO Andrew Wilson)

**Before Buyout**:
- 100+ AI projects already underway
- Stadium creation: 6 months → 6 weeks (AI-assisted)
- Quote: "AI is the very core of our business"
- Focus: "faster, cheaper, higher quality"

**What This Means**: EA was ALREADY aggressive on AI. Buyout ACCELERATES existing trajectory.

## Part 3: The Honest Analysis

### The Fundamental Disconnect

| What They Said in Interview | What Buyout Reality Demands |
|---|---|
| "Exciting AI exploration" | Urgent cost reduction for $20B debt |
| "Loose guidance, experiment & pivot" | Deliver ROI or face cuts yourself |
| "Thought starter for innovation" | Prove headcount savings quickly |
| "What person makes of role" | What investors demand of role |
| "High curiosity about products" | High pressure for results |

### Where AI Cost-Cutting WILL Actually Happen

#### **1. Content Creation Acceleration** ★★★★★

**What They Said**:
- Tracking "time to create asset types"
- Goal: "accelerate these timelines"
- Standardized workback schedules

**What This Means for Cost-Cutting**:
- **Current**: X artists create Y assets in Z time
- **AI Goal**: Same X artists create 2Y assets in Z time OR 0.5X artists create Y assets
- **Investor Translation**: 30-40% artist headcount reduction while maintaining output

**Technologies**:
- Generative AI for screenshot variations
- AI-assisted trailer editing
- Auto-composition tools
- Frostbite AI plugins for faster asset creation

**Your Project Scott Parallel**: Just like Scott reduced documentation bottlenecks, these tools will reduce creative bottlenecks → fewer people needed.

#### **2. Production Tracking & Document Generation** ★★★★☆

**What Daniel Said**:
- "Automated document generation for collecting data from brand, legal, making brief of production"

**What This Means**:
- **Current**: Project managers manually gather requirements → create briefs
- **AI Goal**: LLM scrapes inputs → auto-generates briefs
- **Result**: Reduce PM/coordinator headcount by 40-50%

**Your Expertise Match**: Perfect fit for your RAG/LLM work (Project Scott approach)

#### **3. Render Validation Automation** ★★★☆☆

**What Daniel Said**:
- "Automatically validating renders, like content visuals being generated"
- "Correct size logos, proportions, colors"

**What This Means**:
- **Current**: QA artists manually check every asset
- **AI Goal**: Automated validation catches 90% of issues
- **Result**: Reduce QA artist headcount by 60-70%

**Your Expertise Match**: Computer vision work from VTO project (detecting colors, proportions)

#### **4. Tech Designer Support Reduction** ★★★★☆

**What They Said**:
- Tech Designers handle day-to-day artist issues
- Recurring problems escalated to Software Engineering

**What $20B Debt Demands**:
- **Current**: 20-40 Tech Designers providing hands-on support
- **AI Goal**: AI chatbot + self-service tools handle 70% of issues
- **Result**: Reduce Tech Designer team to 10-15 people

**Your Project Scott**: EXACTLY this use case. Documentation assistant → support reduction.

## Part 4: Where to Focus & Why

### Best Area to Tackle FIRST

**Production Tracking & Document Generation**

**Why**:
1. **Daniel specifically mentioned this** as expansion area
2. **Fast ROI**: 3-6 months to MVP
3. **Clear metrics**: Time to create briefs (measurable in Airtable)
4. **Your expertise**: Perfect match (RAG, LLMs, agentic workflows)
5. **Less politically sensitive**: Doesn't threaten creative roles directly
6. **Foundation for broader automation**: Same tech scales to other areas

**How**:
- RAG system (Pinecone + GPT-4/Claude via AWS Bedrock)
- Scrape brand requirements, legal constraints, production specs
- LLM generates production brief
- One-click approval workflow
- Integration with Airtable tracking

**ROI Pitch**:
> "I can build an AI system that reduces production brief creation time from 2-3 days to 2-3 hours. This frees project managers for higher-value work while accelerating project timelines—directly improving the 'time to create assets' metric you track in Airtable. Based on my Amazon experience with similar automation, we can achieve 60-70% time savings within 6 months."

### Second Priority: Render Validation

**Why**:
- Daniel mentioned this specifically
- Clear technical problem (sizes, proportions, colors)
- Your VTO project = perfect experience match
- Measurable success (validation time reduction)

**How**:
- Computer vision models (AWS Rekognition or custom)
- Logo detection & size validation
- Proportion checking (aspect ratios, placement)
- Color accuracy validation
- Auto-flagging issues for human review

**ROI Pitch**:
> "My Amazon VTO project extracted colors and visual properties from millions of images at scale. I can apply this same computer vision expertise to validate logos, proportions, and colors in EA's marketing assets—reducing manual QA time by 60%+ and catching errors before they reach final review."

### Third Priority (Longer Term): Tech Support Automation

**Why**:
- Project Scott direct parallel
- Rhea emphasized collaboration across teams → this builds community
- Enables other automation (documentation for new tools)

**How**:
- Start with documentation ownership initiative (like Amazon)
- Build Project Scott equivalent for Marketing Org
- RAG + agentic handoff to SMEs
- Self-service troubleshooting for common issues

**ROI Pitch**:
> "I led a similar initiative at Amazon where we built an AI assistant (Project Scott) that reduced documentation queries by 40% and automatically identified gaps. At EA, this would reduce Tech Designer support load while building the documentation foundation needed for scaling your new AI tools across teams."

## Part 5: The Uncomfortable Truths

### What Interview Portrayed vs What You'll Face

**Interview Tone**:
- Exciting greenfield project
- Experimenting with new tech
- Being thought leader
- Loose guidance, make it your own
- Collaborative, fun environment

**Likely Reality** (Given $20B Debt):
- Pressure for measurable cost reduction
- Timeline constraints (12-18 months to prove ROI)
- Tension between "innovation" framing and "cut costs" reality
- Artists/Tech Designers knowing tools threaten their jobs
- Your success measured by headcount savings you enable

### The "Faster, Cheaper, Higher Quality" Lie

**CEO Wilson's Claim**: AI makes things "faster, cheaper, and at a higher quality"

**Physics Reality**: Pick 2 of 3
- **Faster + Cheaper** = Lower quality (what investors want)
- **Faster + Higher Quality** = More expensive (what investors reject)
- **Cheaper + Higher Quality** = Slower (what investors reject)

**Investors Choose**: Faster + Cheaper (quality becomes "good enough")

### Your Ethical Decision

**Are You OK With**:
- Building tools that eliminate coworkers' jobs?
- Being measured by headcount savings you enable?
- "Productivity tools" being code for "replacement systems"?
- Knowing some people you meet in Week 1 won't be there in Year 2?

**No Wrong Answer**:
- **Yes, I'm OK**: Companies need efficiency, EA faces real debt pressure, someone will do this job—might as well be someone who builds good tools
- **No, I'm not OK**: I don't want to be the instrument of job elimination, even if it's "business necessary"

---

## Part 6: Strategic Recommendations

### If You Accept This Role

**Do**:
1. **Frame everything as "productivity gains"** not "headcount reduction" (that's leadership's messaging job)
2. **Build relationships with artists EARLY** before tools threaten jobs—trust matters
3. **Document wins obsessively** in terms they track (Airtable metrics: time savings)
4. **Leverage Rhea's collaboration push** to build allies across EA's AI teams
5. **Start with least threatening wins** (production briefs) before tackling creative roles
6. **Keep tools AUGMENTATIVE** (help artists do more) vs REPLACEMENT (eliminate artists)
7. **Build quality safeguards IN** from start (don't let "faster & cheaper" destroy brand)

**Don't**:
1. **Don't believe the "innovation" framing** entirely—this is cost-cutting with good PR
2. **Don't ignore the human impact**—these are real people with families
3. **Don't over-promise ROI** you can't deliver—under-promise, over-deliver
4. **Don't assume your job is safe**—if automation works TOO well, you're next
5. **Don't skip the exploration phase** Daniel mentioned—EA has resources you need to find
6. **Don't work in a silo**—Rhea emphasized cross-team collaboration for good reason

### How to Navigate Politically

**With Artists**:
- Frame tools as "making your job more interesting" (less tedious work, more creativity)
- Show tools handling the boring parts (validation, documentation, repetitive tasks)
- Get their input EARLY on what they actually want automated
- Never say "this tool will make you 2x more productive" (they hear "we need half as many of you")

**With Leadership**:
- Speak their language: "time to create assets," "scalability," "ROI"
- Show quarterly wins, not just long-term vision
- Tie every project to Airtable metrics they already track
- Emphasize "enables team to do more with current resources" (not "reduces headcount needed")

**With Tech Designers**:
- They're first automation target—build trust BEFORE building their replacement
- Position tools as "handles the boring Tier 1 stuff, you do the interesting Tier 2/3 work"
- Make them co-creators of the support automation (they become tool managers vs tool users)

**With Other AI/ML Teams**:
- Rhea emphasized this—share learnings, avoid duplication
- Cross-pollinate ideas, tools, frameworks
- Build reputation as collaborative thought leader (helps career progression)

## Part 7: What They ACTUALLY Want (Reading Between Lines)

### Daniel's Real Ask

**What He Said**: "Autonomy, no experts on team, establish new ways"

**What He Means**: We don't know how to do this AI stuff, you need to figure it out yourself, we can't guide you much, but we need results.

**Translation**: You're on your own technically, but accountable for outcomes.

### Blaze's Real Ask

**What He Said**: "Loose guidance, experiment & pivot, thought starter"

**What He Means**: We're building this org from scratch under time pressure, we need someone who can move fast without hand-holding.

**Translation**: Startup energy in big company context—high autonomy, high accountability.

### Rhea's Real Ask

**What She Said**: "Collaborate across silos, build community, share knowledge"

**What She Means**: EA is a mess of duplicated work, we're wasting money on redundant AI efforts, someone needs to connect these teams.

**Translation**: Be the person who prevents waste through coordination—this is a COST CONTROL ask.

### All Three Together

**What Success Looks Like** (Decoded):
1. **Autonomously** discover where AI can reduce costs (don't need hand-holding)
2. **Quickly** build POCs that prove ROI (investors want fast results)
3. **Collaborate** to avoid duplication (maximize efficiency of AI spend)
4. **Measure** everything in their language (Airtable metrics)
5. **Be ready** for pressure as buyout debt servicing kicks in

## Part 11: The Meta-Question

### Why Does This Analysis Matter?

**Surface Reason**: Help you decide about the job

**Deeper Reason**: AI tools for creative work = one of the biggest ethical questions of 2020s

**The Tension**:
- Companies NEED efficiency (EA has $20B debt—this is real)
- Workers deserve job security (these are real people with families)
- Technology WILL advance (AI is happening regardless)
- Someone WILL build these tools (if not you, then someone else)

**Your Choice**:
- **Build tools that AUGMENT** → artists do more creative work, less tedious work
- **Build tools that REPLACE** → artists eliminated, shareholders profit
- **Reality**: Probably both, depending on which projects you choose

**The Question**: When you look back in 5 years, will you be proud of what you built?

---

## Final Summary: What You Need to Know

### The Reality Check

1. **Interview was genuine** about role description—they DO want AI innovation
2. **Buyout pressure is real** but unspoken—they ALSO need cost reduction
3. **These aren't contradictory**—to them, "faster asset creation" = innovation AND cost savings
4. **You'll face both**—exciting technical work AND uncomfortable cost-cutting implications

### Best Path Forward

**Focus on AUGMENTATION over REPLACEMENT**:
- Production brief generation = takes tedious work off PMs (augmentation)
- Render validation = catches errors faster (augmentation)
- Support automation = handles Tier 1, humans do complex work (augmentation)

**Avoid PURE REPLACEMENT projects**:
- "AI generates entire trailers without artists" = replacement
- "AI writes all briefs without PM review" = replacement
- "AI handles ALL support tickets" = replacement

**Reality**: Leadership may push you toward replacement eventually. Be ready to navigate that conversation.

### If You Accept

**Go in with eyes open**:
- Know this is cost-cutting work (even if they don't say it)
- But ALSO genuinely interesting technical work
- You CAN build tools that help people (not just eliminate them)
- Success = balancing business needs with human impact

**Your advantage**:
- You understand the real context (this analysis)
- They don't know you know
- You can build tools strategically (augment > replace)
- You can measure success in THEIR terms (time savings) while protecting HUMAN outcomes (job preservation)

Good luck. You'll need both technical skill AND moral clarity.
