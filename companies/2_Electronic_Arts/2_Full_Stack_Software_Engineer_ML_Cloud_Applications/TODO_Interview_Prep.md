## üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - For Interview (Oct 9, 2025)

- [ ] **MOCK INTERVIEW ROUND 1** - End-to-end run with basic answers
  - Practice all Tier 1 questions (from Interview_Prep_Comprehensive.md)
  - Get through full mock interview, even if answers are rough
  - Identify weak spots and areas needing more depth
- [ ] **MOCK INTERVIEW ROUND 2** - Add depth to weak areas
  - Refine answers based on Round 1 feedback
  - Focus on technical deep dives that felt shaky
  - Improve conciseness (30-60 seconds per answer)
- [ ] **MOCK INTERVIEW ROUND 3** - Full realistic simulation
  - Simulate actual interview conditions
  - Practice with interviewer names/roles once known
  - Time each answer, watch for rambling
- [ ] **Record and review each mock** - Address learning points from file 15
- [ ] **Prepare 3-5 questions to ask interviewers** - Once you learn their names/roles

### üîß Technical Review
- [ ] Quick review of AWS services: Lambda, SageMaker, CloudFormation, DynamoDB, API Gateway
- [ ] Review SageMaker deployment process (endpoints, multi-variant, batch transform)
- [ ] Review DynamoDB indexing (GSI vs LSI)

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Learning (Optional)

- Note: You're already familiar with the concept, just be ready to discuss intelligently

### üîß n8n
- [ ] Quick web search if time permits: What is n8n workflow automation tool
- Note: You know it's workflow automation, similar to AWS Step Functions

## üéØ FOCUS FOR NEXT 24 HOURS

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. **PRACTICE OUT LOUD** - This is the #1 learning point from recruiter screen
2. **Master Project Scott 30-second version** - You will definitely get asked about end-to-end ML cloud application
3. **Review Interview_Prep_Comprehensive.md** - Know your Tier 1 questions cold

**Remember from File 15:**
- BE CONCISE: 30-60 seconds, offer to elaborate
- WATCH CUES: Stop when they say "Great" or "Perfect"
- DON'T RAMBLE: You spent 2+ minutes on Project Scott in recruiter screen when 30-45 seconds would work

**You've got this! üöÄ**
