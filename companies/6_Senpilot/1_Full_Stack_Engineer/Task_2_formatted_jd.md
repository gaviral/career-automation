# Full Stack Engineer at Senpilot

## About the job

👉 **Us**

Senpilot (~1 yr old, funded). We're building agentic AI for utilities, automating boring internal processes. We focus on productive, high-value workflows: asset management, regulatory and more use cases everyday – think Palantir exclusively for utilities.

## Industry

Electricity and water providers with big budgets and low churn. Antiquated. Their tools and software suck. AI + electrification terrifies them, and talent is scarce.

## Eng

Bleeding edge of applying AI to Utilities. With each new data source, use AI to figure out how to make it useful. Find the fastest way to deliver value by experimenting, hacking, and applying an 80/20 mindset. We're constantly playing with the newest tools and AI models (eg Gemini Diffusion, Gencast, Claude 4, Devin, etc) and iterating on the problems.

## Team

Humans from Uber, Carta, Airbnb, Nvidia

## Stack

TypeScript, Node, MUI, Prisma, Postgres, GCP (Vertex, Cloud Run, etc).

## You

Essential part of the engineering team. Curious, product-minded, and autonomous, use AI tools to 10x your productivity. You'll own projects from start to finish, shape our roadmap and help us find PMF. You'll move the unmovable to get shit done—whether that means talking to a customer, calling a stranger, or building new tools from scratch with Cursor.
