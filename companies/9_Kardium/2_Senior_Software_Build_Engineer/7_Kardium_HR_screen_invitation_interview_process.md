Thank you for your interest in the Senior Software Build Engineer (Hybrid) position at Kardium. We are excited to inform you that your application has been selected, and we are moving forward with scheduling a general interview. Kindly use this link to choose a suitable time slot. 

Our interview process consists of the following stages:

1. **General Interview with the Talent Team**: An online Teams video call lasting 30-45 minutes.
2. **Take-Home Test**.
3. **Panel 1 Technical Interview**: Involves the immediate team and typically lasts 90-120 minutes.
4. **Panel 2 Technical Interview**: This interview includes team members who closely collaborate with this role and lasts 90-120 minutes.
5. **Executive Interview**: Typically lasts 60 minutes.

For applicants located in Vancouver, please note that at least one interview will be conducted in person. You will receive an invitation to our office, and potentially followed by a company tour. All other interviews will be conducted online.

The entire process may take between 3 to 6 weeks, though the duration may vary depending on several factors. Advancing from one stage to the next requires successful progression. If you require assistance or have any concerns regarding the timeline at any point, please don't hesitate to inform us. We'll collaborate to accommodate your needs to the best of our abilities.

Simultaneously, this process allows us to gain a deeper understanding of your skills. Ultimately, we consider our employees as long-term contributors to our company's success and aim to help you make a well-informed decision that aligns with our mutual goals.

Please note: For the first (general) interview, where we'll talk about your experience, motivations, work style, expectations, and also share more about the role and company, we use Microsoft Teams' built-in transcription feature. This helps us keep accurate notes and give you our full attention during the conversation. The transcript is used only for hiring purposes. At the start of our meeting, we'll ask for your consent before beginning transcription. If you'd prefer not to be transcribed, we'll take notes manually instead.
