**Cursor**

I'll follow the Bob-Cursor interaction loop as specified in the rules. Starting with Step 1 to run `bob-cursor` and get the user's speech-to-text transcript.

**Step 2: Formulate Plan**

Based on the transcript, I need to:
1. Navigate to `data/job_applications_subproject/`
2. Read the `instructions.md` file exhaustively
3. Read the `summary.md` file as well
4. Understand and execute tasks 2, 3, and 4 from those instructions

**Step 3: Execute Tasks**

Now I need to check the temp folder to see what job description needs processing for tasks 2, 3, and 4:

Now I'll execute tasks 2, 3, and 4 as requested. Let me start by reading the raw job description:

Now I'll execute Task 2 - creating the formatted markdown version:

```markdown

Let me verify the folder structure is correct:

Perfect! Let me also clean up the temp folder:

**Step 4: Report Results**

✅ **Tasks 2, 3, and 4 completed successfully for Electronic Arts - Full Stack Software Engineer - ML Cloud Applications position:**

**Task 2**: Created formatted markdown version (`Task_2_formatted_jd.md`) with proper structure, preserving all original content without modification or summarization.

**Task 3**:

All files properly organized in `/data/job_applications_subproject/2_Electronic_Arts/2_Full_Stack_Software_Engineer_ML_Cloud_Applications/`

**Step 5: Repeat Cycle**

**Step 2: Formulate Plan**

Based on the transcript asking "What do you think we should do next?", I need to analyze the current state of the job applications subproject and recommend the optimal next steps.

**Step 3: Execute Tasks**

Let me analyze the current status and identify areas needing attention:

Let me check the companies that have placeholder files and need proper metadata:

Now let me check what companies are missing Task 4 (required skills extraction):

**Step 4: Report Results**

Based on my analysis, here are the **priority next steps** for the job applications subproject:

## 🚨 **Critical Issues to Fix:**

1. **Amazon Folder (7_Amazon/1_ 3052303)** - **COMPLETELY EMPTY**
   - Missing all files (Task_1 through Task_4)
   - Needs complete processing from scratch

2. **Placeholder Files Need Replacement:**
   - `1_US_Tech_Solutions/1_Machine_Learning_Product_Engineer` - Has placeholder instead of proper Task_3
   - `2_Electronic_Arts/1_Machine_Learning_Engineer` - Has placeholder instead of proper Task_3
   - `6_Senpilot/1_Full_Stack_Engineer` - Has both placeholder AND proper Task_3 (cleanup needed)

3. **Missing Task_4 (Skills Extraction):**
   - `1_US_Tech_Solutions` - Missing Task_4
   - `2_Electronic_Arts/1_Machine_Learning_Engineer` - Missing Task_4
   - `3_ODAIA` - Missing Task_4
   - `4_VoyceMe` - Missing Task_4  
   - `5_AI_Tech_Business` - Missing Task_4
   - `6_Senpilot` - Missing Task_4

4. **Missing Task_1 File:**
   - `3_ODAIA` - Has `raw_jd.txt` instead of `Task_1_raw_jd.txt` (naming inconsistency)

## 📋 **Recommended Action Plan:**

**Priority 1**: Fix Amazon folder (complete data loss)
**Priority 2**: Replace placeholder files with proper metadata  
**Priority 3**: Add missing Task_4 files for skills extraction
**Priority 4**: Standardize file naming across all applications

**Immediate next step**: Start with the Amazon folder since it's completely empty and represents the biggest gap in the system.

**Step 5: Repeat Cycle**

**Step 2: Formulate Plan**

The user is asking for additional recommendations without making changes yet. I should provide more strategic analysis of what else could be improved or enhanced in the job applications system.

**Step 3: Execute Tasks**

Let me analyze the system more comprehensively to identify additional opportunities:

Let me also check what existing projects or assets are available:

**Step 4: Report Results**

3. **Success Tracking** - Data-driven application optimization
4. **Company Research Automation** - Scale personalization efforts

**Strategic Value**: These enhancements would transform from manual job processing to an intelligent career acceleration system with measurable ROI.

**Step 5: Repeat Cycle**

**Step 2: Formulate Plan**

Based on the transcript, I need to:
1. Navigate to Electronic Arts full stack software engineer folder
2. Find the new markdown file and rename it with the job title suffix
3. Find the PDF resume file
4. Extract content from PDF exhaustively 
5. Ensure the markdown file is a perfect replica of the PDF with proper formatting

**Step 3: Execute Tasks**

Perfect! I can see the markdown file `Aviral_Garg_Resume_.md` and the PDF file `Aviral_Garg_Resume_sept_18_1.pdf`. Let me first rename the markdown file with the job title suffix:

Now let me read the current markdown file to see what's already there, then extract the PDF content:

Now I need to extract the PDF content to compare and ensure the markdown is a perfect replica. Let me create a Python script to extract PDF content:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
PDF Text Extraction Script
Extracts text from PDF with detailed formatting information
"""
import sys
import os

def extract_pdf_content(pdf_path):
    """Extract text content from PDF file"""
    try:
        # Try PyPDF2 first
        import PyPDF2
        
        with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as file:
            pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
            text_content = []
            
            print(f"PDF has {len(pdf_reader.pages)} pages")
            
            for page_num, page in enumerate(pdf_reader.pages):
                print(f"\n=== PAGE {page_num + 1} ===")
                page_text = page.extract_text()
                text_content.append(page_text)
                print(page_text)
                print(f"\n=== END PAGE {page_num + 1} ===\n")
            
            return '\n\n'.join(text_content)
            
    except ImportError:
        print("PyPDF2 not available, trying pdfplumber...")
        try:
            import pdfplumber
            
            with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
                text_content = []
                print(f"PDF has {len(pdf.pages)} pages")
                
                for page_num, page in enumerate(pdf.pages):
                    print(f"\n=== PAGE {page_num + 1} ===")
                    page_text = page.extract_text()
                    text_content.append(page_text)
                    print(page_text)
                    print(f"\n=== END PAGE {page_num + 1} ===\n")
                
                return '\n\n'.join(text_content)
                
        except ImportError:
            print("pdfplumber not available, trying pymupdf...")
            try:
                import fitz  # PyMuPDF
                
                doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
                text_content = []
                print(f"PDF has {len(doc)} pages")
                
                for page_num in range(len(doc)):
                    page = doc.load_page(page_num)
                    print(f"\n=== PAGE {page_num + 1} ===")
                    page_text = page.get_text()
                    text_content.append(page_text)
                    print(page_text)
                    print(f"\n=== END PAGE {page_num + 1} ===\n")
                
                doc.close()
                return '\n\n'.join(text_content)
                
            except ImportError:
                return "ERROR: No PDF extraction libraries available. Please install PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or PyMuPDF"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python pdf_extractor.py <pdf_file_path>")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    pdf_path = sys.argv[1]
    if not os.path.exists(pdf_path):
        print(f"Error: File {pdf_path} does not exist")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    print(f"Extracting content from: {pdf_path}")
    content = extract_pdf_content(pdf_path)
    print(f"\n\n=== COMPLETE EXTRACTED CONTENT ===")
    print(content)
```

Let me try with python3:

I need to install a PDF extraction library. Let me install PyPDF2:

Now let me run the PDF extraction script:

Now I can see the differences between the PDF and the current markdown. The main issues I notice:

1. **Header formatting**: PDF has contact info on one line, markdown has it formatted differently
2. **Missing bullets**: PDF uses bullet points (•), markdown uses dashes (-)
3. **Some formatting differences**: PDF has different spacing and punctuation
4. **Missing flag emojis**: The markdown has 🚩 flags that aren't in the PDF
5. **Some content differences**: A few minor wording differences

Let me create a perfect replica based on the PDF:
