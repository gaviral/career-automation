## Technology Gap Analysis for Capgemini AI Engineer Role

### **Technologies to ADD to Skills Sections:**

#### **AI & Machine Learning Section - ADD (Critical Missing):**
1. **LangChain** - Core requirement, explicitly mentioned as "strong hands-on experience" needed
2. **CrewAI** - Core requirement, "strong hands-on experience with framework" needed
3. **Google's Agent Development Kit** - Core requirement, "strong hands-on experience" needed
4. **Autogen** - Core requirement, "experience with agentic workflow framework" needed
5. **Prompt Engineering** - Already present but needs to be made more explicit

#### **Technologies & Tools Section - ADD (High Priority):**
1. **Agentic Workflows** - Design and implementation capabilities
2. **Agent Communication** - Python-based modules for orchestration
3. **Natural Language Interfaces** - Integration with backend data layers
4. **Agent-based Systems** - Design, development, and optimization
5. **Multi-agent Systems** - Advanced coordination and collaboration

#### **Domain-Specific Section - ADD (New Section):**
1. **Food Delivery Analytics** - Domain context from job description
2. **Conversational Chart Generation** - Core platform functionality
3. **Data Visualization Integration** - Working with visualization teams
4. **Business Intelligence** - Chart generation from natural language queries

#### **Production & Deployment - ENHANCE:**
1. **Production Deployment** - Enhance existing AWS deployment with agentic focus
2. **System Scalability** - Already strong, but emphasize agentic context
3. **Performance Optimization** - Already present, add agentic system focus

### **Specific Additions Recommended:**

#### **Enhanced AI & Machine Learning Section:**
```markdown
*   **AI & Machine Learning:** Generative AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama), LangChain, CrewAI, Google's Agent Development Kit, Autogen, Agentic Orchestration & Frameworks, MCP, RAG, NLP, LLMs, Prompt Engineering, Model Deployment (SageMaker Endpoints, Batch Transform), Vector Databases, Python (ML Libraries)
```

#### **Enhanced Languages & Frameworks Section:**
```markdown
*   **Languages & Frameworks:** Python (Flask, FastAPI), Node.js, React, TypeScript, Kotlin, C#
```
*Note: No changes needed here as Python is the primary focus for this role*

#### **NEW Agentic AI Systems Section:**
```markdown
*   **Agentic AI Systems:** Multi-Agent Orchestration, Agent Communication, Natural Language Interfaces, Agent-based Systems, Agentic Workflows, External API Integration, Production Deployment
```

#### **NEW Food Delivery Intelligence Section:**
```markdown
*   **Food Delivery Intelligence:** Conversational Chart Generation, Data Visualization Integration, Business Intelligence, Food Delivery Analytics, Natural Language Queries
```

### **Rationale for Each Addition:**

#### **LangChain Addition (CRITICAL):**
- **Job Requirement**: Explicitly mentioned as core requirement with "strong hands-on experience"
- **Gap Closure**: Most critical missing technology
- **Competitive Necessity**: Essential for role qualification

#### **CrewAI Addition (CRITICAL):**
- **Job Requirement**: "Strong hands-on experience with framework" explicitly required
- **Gap Closure**: Critical for multi-agent orchestration
- **Technical Necessity**: Core platform technology

#### **Google's Agent Development Kit (CRITICAL):**
- **Job Requirement**: "Strong hands-on experience" explicitly mentioned
- **Gap Closure**: Production deployment of agentic solutions
- **Enterprise Focus**: Google-grade production systems

#### **Autogen Addition (CRITICAL):**
- **Job Requirement**: "Experience with agentic workflow framework" required
- **Gap Closure**: Alternative agentic framework expertise
- **Framework Diversity**: Shows breadth of agentic AI knowledge

#### **Agentic Systems Section:**
- **Job Context**: Role is specifically for "Agentic AI Developer"
- **Technical Focus**: Demonstrates specialized expertise in agentic systems
- **Competitive Advantage**: Shows deep specialization in required domain

#### **Food Delivery Intelligence Section:**
- **Job Context**: Role is at "leading food delivery company"
- **Platform Focus**: Multi-agentic platform for chart generation
- **Domain Expertise**: Shows understanding of business context

### **Implementation Priority:**

#### **High Priority (Critical for Role):**
1. LangChain (explicitly required)
2. CrewAI (explicitly required)
3. Google's Agent Development Kit (explicitly required)
4. Autogen (explicitly required)

#### **Medium Priority (Strong Enhancement):**
1. Agentic AI Systems section (specialized expertise)
