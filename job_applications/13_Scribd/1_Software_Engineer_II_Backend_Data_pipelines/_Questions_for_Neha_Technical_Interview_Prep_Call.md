## ‚≠ê PRIORITY QUESTIONS (HIGHEST IMPACT - Ask First)

### 1. **Coding Interview Structure**
**Question:** "Can you walk me through what the coding interview will look like? Is it LeetCode-style algorithms, or more practical/applied coding problems related to data pipelines?"

**Why this matters:** 
- Determines if I should focus on algorithm practice (LeetCode) vs. practical Python/data engineering problems
- **Preparation impact:** HIGH - directs 70% of technical prep time

**Expected answer:** Likely practical coding (data processing, APIs, pipeline logic) given it's a data engineering role

---

### 2. **System Design Scope & Scale**
**Question:** "For the system design interview, should I focus on general distributed systems design, or specifically on data pipeline / metadata extraction architecture at Scribd's scale?"

**Why this matters:**
- Determines if prep should be generic system design patterns vs. Scribd-specific challenges
- **Preparation impact:** HIGH - focuses system design prep

**Expected answer:** Likely Scribd-specific (metadata extraction, LLM integration, 250M document scale)

---

### 3. **Technical Interviewer Background**
**Question:** "Who will I be interviewing with for the technical rounds? Are they from Sachin's team, or other teams at Scribd?"

**Why this matters:**
- Helps tailor responses to interviewer's expertise area
- Can research their background on LinkedIn
- **Preparation impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - helps customize examples

**Expected answer:** Likely 1-2 engineers from Sachin's ML Data Engineering team

---

### 4. **Coding Language Expectation**
**Question:** "For the coding interview, should I use Python, or are they open to other languages? And will I need to know Scala or Spark syntax specifically?"

**Why this matters:**
- Python is my strength, need to confirm it's acceptable
- Clarifies if I need crash course on Scala/Spark syntax
- **Preparation impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - determines language-specific prep

**Expected answer:** Likely Python is fine (Sachin mentioned team uses Python heavily for newer pipelines)

---

### 5. **Time Allocation**
**Question:** "How much time is allocated for each part - coding and system design? Are they separate interviews or combined?"

**Why this matters:**
- Helps practice under realistic time constraints
- Determines depth expected in each area
- **Preparation impact:** MEDIUM - helps with time management practice

**Expected answer:** Likely 45-60 min each, separate sessions

---

## ‚úÖ SECONDARY QUESTIONS (GOOD TO KNOW - Ask If Time Permits)

### 6. **Real-World vs. Theoretical**
**Question:** "For the coding portion, will I be expected to write production-ready code with error handling and testing, or more focused on algorithm logic?"

**Why this matters:**
- Determines level of detail needed in coding responses
- **Preparation impact:** MEDIUM - affects coding style practice

---

### 7. **System Design Tools**
**Question:** "For the system design interview, will I be drawing on a whiteboard/virtual board, or is it more of a conversational discussion?"

**Why this matters:**
- Determines if I should practice diagramming vs. verbal explanations
- **Preparation impact:** MEDIUM - changes practice format

---

### 8. **AWS-Specific Expectations**
**Question:** "Given the team uses AWS heavily, should I be prepared to discuss specific AWS services (Lambda, SageMaker, Step Functions) in my answers, or keep it more cloud-agnostic?"

**Why this matters:**
- Leverages my AWS expertise vs. generic responses
- **Preparation impact:** MEDIUM - determines if AWS-specific prep is valuable

**Expected answer:** Likely AWS-specific is a plus (Sachin mentioned they're AWS shop)

---

### 9. **LLM/ML Integration Questions**
**Question:** "Should I expect questions specifically about LLM integration or ML model deployment, given that's a bonus qualification in the JD?"

**Why this matters:**
- This is my competitive advantage - want to showcase it
- **Preparation impact:** MEDIUM - determines if I should prepare LLM-specific examples

**Expected answer:** Likely yes (Sachin was interested in my LLM cost optimization approach)

---

### 10. **Team Member Feedback**
**Question:** "After my interview with Sachin, were there any specific areas he suggested I should focus on or be prepared to discuss in more depth?"

**Why this matters:**
- Direct insight into perceived gaps or areas of interest
- **Preparation impact:** HIGH if there's specific feedback

**Expected answer:** May not share, but worth asking

---

## ‚è∞ TIMING QUESTIONS (LOGISTICS)

### 11. **Interview Timeline**
**Question:** "What's the timeline for the technical interviews? When should I expect to hear about scheduling?"

**Why this matters:**
- Helps plan prep time
- **Preparation impact:** LOW (logistics only)

---

### 12. **Same Day vs. Separate Days**
**Question:** "Will the coding and system design interviews happen on the same day, or spread across multiple days?"

**Why this matters:**
- Affects stamina/preparation strategy
- **Preparation impact:** LOW (logistics only)

---

### 13. **Interview Duration**
**Question:** "Should I block off a specific amount of time for each session, or is there flexibility?"

**Why this matters:**
- Helps with calendar planning
- **Preparation impact:** LOW (logistics only)

---

## üéØ OPTIONAL STRATEGIC QUESTIONS (If Time & Rapport)

### 14. **Team's Technical Priorities**
**Question:** "From what Sachin shared about the 2026 roadmap (scalable LLM platform, 250M documents), are there specific technical challenges the team wants to assess during the interview?"

**Why this matters:**
- Aligns prep with actual team needs
- **Preparation impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH

---

### 15. **Feedback on Hiring Manager Interview**
**Question:** "Is there anything from my conversation with Sachin that you think would be helpful for me to know as I prepare for the technical round?"

**Why this matters:**
- May reveal areas to strengthen
- **Preparation impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH if feedback is shared

---
