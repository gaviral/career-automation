# Learning Points from All Interviews So Far

## Key Takeaways

### What Went Wrong
- **I rambled a lot** during the recruiter screen
  - Got into too much detail about Project Scott
  - Went on tangents when asked simple questions
  - Tyler had to redirect me back to the main point several times
- **Lacked practice**: Need to practice saying these things multiple times out loud before the actual interview
  - Having bullet point notes helped, but wasn't enough
  - Needed more rehearsal to stay concise

### What Went Well
- **Project Scott example was well-received**
  - Tyler seemed impressed and understood the impact
  - Good demonstration of AI/ML skills
- **Game dev experience was highlighted as a BIG PLUS**
  - Tyler specifically encouraged me to mention this
  - Said it's not required but "certainly a plus"
- **Cross-functional collaboration examples resonated**
  - Tyler emphasized this is "a big part of the role"
  - My UBC capstone leadership examples were good
- **Showed genuine interest in the role**
  - Asked good questions about team mission and 60/90/120-day expectations
  - Tyler appreciated the curiosity

### Specific Issues Identified
1. **Too much detail on Project Scott**: Spent 2+ minutes explaining when 30-45 seconds would suffice
2. **Repeated "kind of" and "like" a lot**: Even after filler word removal, transcription shows frequent usage
3. **Long-winded answers**: When asked "What made you interested in this role?", went into full Project Scott story instead of giving 2-3 key points first
4. **Asked too many clarifying questions**: Tyler had to say "I'll let them go into details of that" multiple times

## Action Items for Future Interviews

### Immediate Practice (Before Next Interview)
- ⚠️ **Practice out loud 5+ times**: Say the answers multiple times before the interview
  - Time yourself: "Tell me about yourself" should be 60-90 seconds MAX
  - Record yourself and listen back
  - Focus on staying under time limits

- ⚠️ Focus on being **concise and impactful**
  - Answer the question asked, THEN offer to elaborate
  - Use the **2-point rule**: Make 2 key points, then pause
  - Don't explain everything at once

- ⚠️ Use the **STAR method** for behavioral questions
  - Situation (10 seconds)
  - Task (10 seconds)
  - Action (30 seconds)
  - Result (10 seconds with metric)
  - Total: 60 seconds

### Content Preparation
- ✅ Create comprehensive prep guides with bullet points
- ⚠️ **Prepare 30-second Project Scott pitch**: Quick impact statement
  - "Built AI agent that answered team questions from internal docs"
  - "Improved resolution time 82%, saved 240 dev-hours/month"
  - "Integrated with ticketing system, achieved 100% documentation"
  - STOP. Let them ask for details.

- ⚠️ **Prepare game dev examples**: Tyler specifically highlighted this as valuable
  - UBC capstone with game developers
  - Leading technical teams while coordinating with content creators
  - Bridge between technical and creative teams

### Interview Technique
- ⚠️ **Answer first, elaborate second**
  - "What interests you about the role?" → "Three things: technical fit, AI/ML focus, cross-functional work. Want me to elaborate?"
  - Don't launch into 2-minute stories immediately

- ⚠️ **Watch for interviewer cues**
  - If they say "That's exactly what I was looking for" → STOP talking
  - If they say "Great" or "Perfect" → Move on
  - If they're taking notes → Pause to let them catch up

- ⚠️ **Save questions for appropriate times**
  - Don't interrupt the flow with too many clarifying questions
  - Take notes during their explanation, ask at the end
  - Tyler had to redirect me multiple times
