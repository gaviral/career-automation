## OVERALL INTERVIEW STRATEGY

**Panel Dynamic:**
1. **Daniel** (Hiring Manager) = Overall fit + technical breadth + culture
2. **Blaze** (Director) = Cross-functional collaboration + operational impact + leadership
3. **Rhea** (Tech Director) = Technical depth + cloud architecture + scalability

**Your Winning Formula:**
- **Q1 likely = "Walk through an ML cloud application"** → Use **Project Scott** (emphasizes technical depth for Rhea, full-stack for Daniel)
- **Q2 likely = "Describe cross-functional collaboration"** → Use **VTO Project** (perfect for Blaze, shows game dev context for Daniel)
