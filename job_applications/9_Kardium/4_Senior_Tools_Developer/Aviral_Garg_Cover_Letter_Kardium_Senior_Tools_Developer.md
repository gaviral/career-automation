**Subject: Application for Senior Tools Developer (Req #422)**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Senior Tools Developer position at Kardium. Having followed your groundbreaking atrial fibrillation work and recent FDA approval of the Globe® Pulsed Field System, I am eager to contribute development tools supporting this innovative technology.

My background building development tools and automation frameworks directly aligns with this role's requirements. At Amazon, I achieved:
• Multi-language experience across Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Kotlin, Ruby, rapidly adapting diverse technology stacks under tight project requirements
• High-impact solutions processing 40TB daily with 100% test coverage while seamlessly transitioning between multiple technology stacks
• Production-grade CI/CD expertise with AWS CDK, architecting 4-staged automated pipelines eliminating 95% deployment errors, saving 12+ developer-hours weekly
• Developer tooling innovation via Project Scott—AI documentation assistant achieving 82% faster resolution, 240+ monthly developer-hours savings

I excel building developer tools transforming productivity and rapid context switching across diverse domains. My automation initiatives cut onboarding time 75%, generating 3,528 annual developer-hours savings, while my CodeGuru Profiler leadership across 7 projects translates to your static analysis needs.

My technical leadership delivered 100% documentation completion across engineering organizations through systematic workshops and platforms, while my mission-critical systems experience serving 50+ million users instilled reliability and quality standards essential for regulated environments. My TDD/Unit Testing expertise supports development processes, and I excel communicating complex concepts and building consensus around tooling.

The opportunity leveraging my passion for developer productivity tools supporting your Globe® Mapping and Ablation System teams is compelling. I am eager contributing expertise in code generation, static analysis, workflow automation, and testing frameworks delivering tools improving outcomes.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward discussing how my tools and automation experience can contribute to Kardium.

Sincerely,
Aviral Garg
