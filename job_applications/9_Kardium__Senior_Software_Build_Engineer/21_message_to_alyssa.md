Hey! Had the interview with Sara.

Questions Asked:
Why Kardium/this role, how my Amazon experience transfers to build engineering, Java vs. Python experience, cross-functional collaboration workflow, career goals (2 and 5 years), behavioral (disagreement with coworker), logistics (commute/start date/vacation), and salary expectations.

The Good:
- Communicated all the points I wanted to - tied together my CI/CD passion, healthcare interest, and operational readiness mindset
- Hopefully technical panel is next (should be late next week if I get selected)
- Sara was friendly and straightforward about the process

The Not-So-Great:
- Interview felt pretty scripted/checkbox-y. Sara didn't seem super prepared (mixed up details, asked redundant questions after I'd already answered, sent wrong email with incorrect details about take-home assignment).
- Standard HR screen vibe. Not the strongest first touchpoint to represent the company - just my take, but who am I to judge?
- Salary discussion came in at $100-110k vs. the $140k posted max. Bit of a surprise.

She said she'll present my profile to the DevOps team lead, so we'll see! Thank you so much for all the help with the interview prep so far. Might bug you more if I have more questions for the next steps.
