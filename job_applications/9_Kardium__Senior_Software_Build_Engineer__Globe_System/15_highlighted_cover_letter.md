**Subject: Application for Senior Software Build Engineer (Req #353)**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the **Senior Software Build Engineer** position at **Kardium**. Having followed Kardium's pioneering work, I am deeply impressed by your mission to deliver the best treatment for **atrial fibrillation**. The recent success of your pivotal clinical study for the **Globe® Pulsed Field System** is a landmark achievement, and the opportunity to contribute to the **reliability and efficiency of the software** behind such a life-changing medical device would be incredibly meaningful.

My background in **automating development lifecycles** is a direct match for this role. My experience includes:

*   Proficiency in **Python**, used to create custom automation tooling that saved **7 developer hours weekly**, and **Kotlin**, used to architect critical applications achieving **100% test coverage**.
*   Designing and implementing **automated CI/CD pipelines** using **AWS CDK** and **Azure DevOps**, which eliminated manual deployments and saved over **12 dev-hours/week**.

I am passionate about **building tools that improve developer velocity**. At Amazon, I developed Project "Scout," a local-only **Python-based AI agent** to solve **documentation bottlenecks**. It could instantly answer developer questions, **identify documentation gaps**, and integrate with ticketing systems, achieving an **82% improvement in question resolution time** and projecting **240+ monthly developer-hours saved**. This experience of proactively **creating tools to support engineering teams** is central to the **Senior Build Engineer** role.

My commitment to efficiency is also shown in my work **automating developer onboarding**, a project that reduced new-hire setup time by **75%** and saved **3,528 developer-hours annually**.

While I have not worked directly in a medical device company, my experience building systems processing **40TB of data daily** and **reducing on-call incidents** has given me a deep appreciation for the **reliability, security, and quality** paramount in a **regulated setting**.

The opportunity to apply my skills in **automation, CI/CD, and developer tool creation** to help commercialize the **Globe® System** is a compelling prospect. I am eager to contribute to the efficiency of your **development and test teams** as you enter this exciting new phase.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my qualifications further.

Sincerely,

Aviral Garg
