One thing I do mention in the
point is do not increase the number of tokens or anything in the tell me about yourself part itself.
Is about how
Good morning, everyone.
Hi. Good morning. How are you doing?
I'm doing well. Thank you. How are you? I'm doing very good. Thank you for asking.
Of course. Abiral, thanks for making the time to
speak with me. I work on talent team, partnering with different teams for their hirings.
So you can see that this conversation is going to be very general conversation.
About your experience, background, motivations.
I'll also share with you what we have here at Cardium.
I think you have already talked to Michael, so you have some
insight into what we do, but then that makes my life easier because, like, I
would
high level information as well, and then then we make sure we address any questions you might have.
Definitely. Also, recording the transcription for notes
taking and checking with you if you are fine with that. Absolutely. I am.
And also, it wasn't just my even Alyssa. I I
talked to her quite a bit. I know she's on a medical leave right now.
Right. But yeah. Yeah. She's she's a good friend of mine. We have
known each other for for a long time, so kind of connected with both Mike and Alisa. Yeah. Okay. That's nice.
Yeah. Alyssa.
Alicia. Right? Alyssa Simon or Oh,
Simon. Okay. Okay. That one. Because, like, I I thought of your
talking about Alicia. Okay. No. No. Alicia, I think
she she mentioned good things about you and how both of you also
connected, I think, in some worksheets
I'm sorry if I'm not remembering this thing correctly.
I think so. Yeah. Like,
we are connect, but I don't know. No. It's women's ERG. It's not a
Oh, right. Right. Right. I'm also on women's ERG.
Empowering women. Oh, nice. That's great.
Okay. So to like, and another heads up, like, I
be looking around. The reason why is that I have your
resume on this screen. I have some questions
there. And then the camera is up there, and the the video is here so they can
see that you are moving around. Like, my eyes go go
around, but then it doesn't mean that I'm not paying attention. Like, I'm just
trying to tackle between different screens.
Completely understandable. I I do have my notes as well.
Just in case there are some numbers and some, you know, things pop up.
So kinda like disclaimer from my end as well if that's okay with you. But if not, I can even take
like yeah. Put them away if you like. Whatever your preference is.
That's okay. Like, thank you for giving me the heads up. Of course. That
like, this is a conversation. Like, this is not
to grill you. This is just another Of course. Yeah.
Okay. Thank you for the heads up, though. Of course. To start,
with, I'm curious. Other than, like, you
know, some stuff about Cardium, what interests you in our company,
and this specific role.
Absolutely. I'll I'll try now
straight right into this. And I'd say I think I remember having, like,
three biggest reasons, that, really
and intrigued me about this role. Having talked to Alyssa,
and knowing more and more about it, I think those three points would be, like, the the biggest
obviously, is the meaningful health impact. Right?
Second would be the the the perfect technical alignment
There's so much to my passion about, like, CICD.
That I'm sure we'll go more into that. But that that is something that's
specifically in this so the build engineer role.
Relative to there were other roles as well, but this one was really something that intrigued me. And third thing would be the culture and the team.
From everything that I've learned about it, it yeah.
That would be one of the points.
For the medical field point, I'd say
I've always been interested in the medical field.
At UBC where I did my computer software engineering.
I chose for my final year capstone project, a neurotech HoloLens project where
you could actually like, in augmented reality using the HoloLens app
I don't know if you know about that device, but you can see, like, in front of the, like,
class, they would do demonstrations, and you could see
two big brains floating around. And you could compare a healthy brain
with, like, a diseased brain.
And even Right. Things like, you know, you say the word love.
Whatever the person is feeling and seeing in that which part of their brain
lights up, you would see that in real time
So that these kind of the things were, like, it would just always fascinated me.
And, yeah, just that that option of the health care focus
is I see that Cardium doing such a great thing with
is is, like, literally lifesaving work.
That takes it to a whole new level with creating the catheter for the
ablation for for I I I remember, like,
doing ablation in part of the heart that
prove like, where the incorrect flutters
are going. That that's my, like, very bird eye view understanding of it.
Yeah. For the
alignment part that I mentioned, I'll wrap it up real quick.
But, yeah, the technical alignment part, the second point that I mentioned,
CICD and building tools. Right?
I've done that at Amazon at a massive scale.
If you, like if I were to talk about any of my projects, you would see that
none of them like like, even though I did a lot of software
app development,
at Amazon, we did not have separate DevOps teams.
We were the owners of our own product, and
before we actually built anything, we would always
create the CICD pipeline first. We would create the tooling around it first.
To make sure we're delivering the right thing. It almost felt
like, like, even though we were in beauty tech, but it felt like the
mindfulness about how careful we are about things
It felt like we were in a health care field where where, like,
like, people's life are, like, you know, in
like, of course, there's a little bit of, like like,
just the culture itself of how things were. But I've
felt that that's kinda how I felt. Right? And Yeah.
Yeah. Lastly, I'd say I'm, like, ready to apply those
like, that training to the meaningful impact. Right? Like,
helping improve lives of, millions. So I think
my this role exactly aligns with my experience and
I'd say I felt like all the pieces came together
and the CICD expertise, the passion for health impact,
and the cultural values that I've learned about. I won't go too much into that
culture value part, but because you probably already know about it.
I I can if you'd like me to about what I understood about it.
All good. Thank you so much. That that's why I'm saying that they like,
they make my life easier when
I'm a referral at Cartium because, like, they they share with you so much.
That, like, I don't have to really, like, go Exactly.
It's, like, culture and, like, those details. Thank you for sharing.
So to to get more specific,
with your role with Amazon,
like, I'm curious. You had to dip
you work on two different teams at cardio. Software Development. At Amazon. Yes. And
so sorry. I'm all good. As software for a little bit. Yes.
And then so
can you share a little bit more details? Like, how does those
experiences or projects that you focused on is
transferable to this role. This role
is under the DevOps team. Right?
But then it's interface between
software test and tools. Right? So it's a mix
of, like, the two. Mhmm. So I want to understand, like, from your
perspective reading the job posting, what have you
that you think is applicable to what we are looking for?
100%. I think one of the biggest things here, like, saw in the job
was about the, like, the build chains about
like, monitor like, granular system monitoring
You are we are tracking bottlenecks.
Having CICD, the tooling around it. I know I mentioned
tiny bit in my previous answer about how first thing that we thought about was always CICD pipeline.
About operational readiness. So at Amazon, that's one thing I'm quite proud of.
Is we weren't just build like, here's our task that's given to us.
And, like, I'm done with my task. Like like, it's someone else's problem now.
No. We because we are the ones who are going to maintain it. We take it all the way
product requirements to all the way to maintaining it
forever. Right? So the first thing we do before we even do
actual software development,
create a operational readiness review.
This is a big document that we create where we talk about
operations operations and operations, which is the tooling.
How are we going to test things? When things break,
how long will it take for me to debug that issue?
Am I keeping good track of all the bills that we have?
We are going to deploy so many softwares, so many versions of the same thing.
Am I keeping a good documentation about it?
Am I being that bridge between the software development, which
myself am going to do, and the tooling
and the people around me that who I'll be dealing with.
So at that level, what I'd say at Amazon Beauty Tech,
I built a four stage CICD pipe
Python build chain, which had those granular
system monitoring and bottleneck tracing. I can go more in details
but I'd say, if if you like. But, like, I'd say,
from a overall perspective, the impact of it was, like, I received organization wide
accolades just for, like, building the robust documentation
and the operational readiness that we did in every step of held SDLC.
I'll let oh, go ahead.
I'm sorry. Like, I thought you were done. Go ahead. I
Oh, yeah. I I I was just saying that in this
I'd led, like, a team of eight engineers where we built
like, a serverless data pipeline, had
40 plus million customers. Like, we serve them across
15 different countries, and, like, we had increased the free
of the improvements by 50% because of of the pipeline
that I built because it of the tooling that we had
built all around it. And one key thing I would say
to wrap it up with the Prime Pantry team that I worked at before the beauty tech team I actually championed AWS CDK
adoption throughout the team. It we didn't have proper standards of
how we were creating our pipelines. I actually went ahead
and created a whole standardized CICD process
so that everyone else in the team could follow. Again, it was the same thing
It was you can see how even though there was dev app development, but the
part about CICD tooling and everything
kept keep keep that kept coming in
along with documentation, and I kind of created the new standards.
Even in software development because of my
passion in CICD coming back in. One small example
I'd give is, even outside work,
Like, this passion for CICD isn't just at work. Even outside
that, like, how I've approached more than
30 projects personal projects, all of them have CICD in them.
Right now, if I could go, like, even my website, like, it's not just
I created something and it just, like, shows up there. It has testing
even though, like, people usually don't do that. One project that I have
which has more than 8,000 downloads on the, like,
a very popular website. Even that
is, like, it has build numbers and software versioning numbers.
So that right there made me think, hey. Why not? Actually, this is my key passion.
That I keep coming back to. Why don't I actually, like,
apply for this build engineer senior build engineer position and and just
thrive there. Combine it with my
passion for, like, health care and seeing all those those
great cultural values that the company brings.
Okay. That's awesome. Thanks for sharing.
And then I can see a lot of Python here.
What about working with Java?
It is some so one thing I would say is my go to definitely is
Python. But I have
dealt with Java, even Kotlin. At Prime Pantry, I had, like,
like, I remember create one of my first tasks at Prime Pantry was to work with
Kotlin. And I created the API and it received, like, 100% test coverage that no one had received before.
So, again, the the this thing came in, but
even though I I wouldn't say I'm, like, a perfect expert at
Kotlin slash Java. They're very similar.
But I've dealt with seven different languages
at Amazon, like and four of them I'd never
dealt with them before in the past. But that never hindered me from
ever delivering things quickly and learning those things up
because we've always been like, at least me personally, I've always been agnostic of
what language I'm using. The guiding principles are always the same.
Of course, this doesn't work when you are in, like, a c plus plus role
very low level. But I feel like at build engineering level,
this is something that comes in very handy where having
sufficient knowledge about how languages work in general
should be very easy for me to pick it up, Java, Kotlin. Yeah.
Yeah.
Agree. When you know object oriented language, then it should be
pretty, like, easy transition. The reason I ask you is that I know
our team is is using Python. However,
our software test team and like,
almost, like, all the teams, they use Java mainly and then Python.
Correct. So, like, Java would be the, kinda, like, main language, though I don't know,
once they develop something that they are like, no. Like, we don't want to use Java. Let's do Python.
And then
in terms of the interactions that you had
within those team projects,
How was the workflow for you? Like,
where did you get your input? Like,
which teams or, let's say, job titles did you work with?
And then where the result of your work was going?
Yeah. I'm trying
flow and interactions. 100%. And don't
of interaction and, like, the kind of people I've worked with,
I've had a wide variety of people that I've had a chance to work with.
Like, from school projects to internships to Amazon.
I've had a chance to deal with neuroscientists. I've had a chance to deal with doctors.
Japanese language professors, product managers,
software development managers, a lot of, like, dealing with business intelligence
because we're working backward from what not only what are we creating, but why are we
and what impact are we going to have. Like,
I've had a chance to deal with, like, even technical artists and and, like, creative writers.
Like, it's one thing I've always seen is it's never really
an issue for me to being able to understand
be in the someone else's shoes and understand that they're not technical people.
They understand things, what are happening at the big picture, and what they want things to be
done. So my process usually is
let's focus on not how the engineer is going to fix this issue
or create this new feature. It's always about
what are we working on? Is there a pain point?
Let's work backward from there. Or what new feature or what new product
that you want to create, let's work backward from there. What does that really do?
And then we talk about like, I I usually take the abstraction of
the technical things and be able to communicate very efficiently
with people from a variety of different, like, fields.
In terms of the results that you asked, like, how does that drive the results?
I've had, like, in the all the project like, the projects that I've dealt with,
simple personal projects, I I remember mentioning
of like, in a simple open source project,
I had, like, 8,000 more than actually 8,000 downloads
an open source person project that I created. That's something
I don't think it's, like, too big, but at the same time worth mentioning.
But taking it to the bigger picture level, I've like, the
data pipelines that I've worked with where I dealt with
even makeup artists and dealt with, like,
learning so much about bronzer and foundation and
like, I know too many things about makeup now because I dealt with those people.
And I've now those pipelines are serving more than 40,000,000 customers worldwide
15 countries. And and, yeah, just like like,
there are transactions happening on those things.
Like like,
in billions of scales. Like, you know, there are billion interactions
with the products that I've built. I can go even more detailed if you like
but I think this kinda gives you an overall gist of where I'm coming from. Yeah.
Thank you so much. And then, Abirall,
what is your career goal at this point?
Where do you see yourself in the next two and five years? What do you want to achieve?
Absolutely. So this answer, I think I can give you by
seeing how my journey has been very briefly on
at UBC. I did, like, learn about computer software
foundational principles. I applied those in health care, and
in other areas as well. Then
after that, I went to t four g consultancy where
I learned about how to quickly transition from talking to very different kind
people. I've dealt with, like, very different like, there was a tire company, and then there was this
medical company, and then even, like, someone who sells the baseboards and, like, houses.
Creating chatbots. So that was an experience where I applied
what I learned at UBC, applied that in different areas.
At Amazon, I learned how to now apply those same things at a
scale, how to take that to millions, not millions, billions of customers.
Right?
With that, I feel like this almost feels like a training phase
And now to me,
I'm like, where can I apply those things and go
more and more towards making a big impact? And that right there, I think, would
help me answer the two year and five year question is
being at Cardium feels like this is one place I can
apply all my learning into making a bigger impact in health care.
And to to people. Two years, I'm seeing myself
like, being the software build engineer who is now, like, up
doing more career growth inside Cardium itself.
And taking over more responsibility, if possible. Right?
If possible being, like like, I'm not sure exactly how the the courier chain
and the growth works at Cardium, but definitely taking on more roles
having more bigger projects, and taking on more developers for doing mentorship for them. And I feel like it's something very similar
for five year term as well because that right there would be
just continuing to grow in the field, in the company,
and making that impact. Of course, that depends also on, like, how
Cardium sees me as, like, the person doing that work.
And for me, if, like, how things align.
Of course, with my values, I I so
see that right now with Cardium, all the things that I've heard.
I'm sure after experiencing that idea would only reinforce
and become even stronger.
Right. Right. Okay. Thank you for sharing.
We are a growing company for sure. Like, we are at a stage that there are a lot of
for growth. Though, like, nothing is guaranteed
in life, I
there are a lot of avenues that people
they can grow. Also, we have a huge co op program where, like,
people, they can develop on their leadership skills as well, like, taking full responsibility.
For a co op. I found that
way to be a very kinda, like, good way to really, like, be a leader
quicker. Also, like, we have a lot of projects
internal projects that people, they can take ownership on and then develop their
project management skills.
Like, I don't know, like, what it it looks
like in the next two, three years. Right. But that
this is what I know and what I've
experienced myself first on that cardio. Understanding your work
working side, my next question is about that.
Can you share an experience of a time when you had a difference of opinion with a co
worker. What was the situation, and how did you handle that?
Absolutely. This actually reminds me of one such
where in the virtual try on,
project, the one of the biggest projects that I worked at Amazon Beauty Tech,
And to give you a tiny bit of context, it was like, if you go on Amazon app right now,
click on a lipstick and click a VTO button, you can actually try that lipstick
see what that would look like in augmented reality. Like, you know, you would see yourself
and that lipstick, a three d asset created, right on your lips.
Being tracked. Right? Now the project that we worked on was
extracting the visual properties. What is the finished type?
Like, is it matte finish? Is it shiny? The RGB colors.
And what what are the particles? If there are any, what is their size?
Given having given you the context of what we worked on,
there was a group with a colleague
of mine, he was actually a senior engineer.
And, we had a disagreement about
the design that we were proposing.
There were two kinds of design for this. One was
e c two. Like, I'm on a very big level. I'll just tell you that
there was server architecture and then a serverless architecture.
And he said that we should go for a server
whereas I said server less. And we had a dis disagreement about this.
And it was a very good healthy discussion, but he continued to say
that he is correct. And I said, my and
and that was You were saying that you you
you were correct. So it's more so, like and we didn't obviously
say that. It was more so about, like, I think that this is
the right approach. And he had believed in his approach.
So the and it was a very quick discussion. After that, how we how I resolved that
was I actually create like, we were to create a system wide
diagrams, create a whole system design, and propose the solution.
Right? So what I did in this situation
was we set up a meeting with him and me
where I'd showed him, like, why I think this design
what are the advantages and even disadvantages of my approach
and showed the advantages and disadvantages of his approach
And we actually, like, discussed more details about
why the cost of this approach is, like, higher.
Of of the approach that he went for. But it was like, there were
parts about it that were good too.
But it wasn't that important. Like, it it would serve things very fast.
But we did not need things to be real time. We needed things to be
like like, it can take one day, and that's completely fine because
we had five days of waiting and if it take one day instead of one hour,
that's completely fine. Right? And he actually agreed with my approach
And once I had his traction and he agreed with
like, he generally saw that, like, this was a much better approach.
We even had a team wide discussion after that, and everyone
like, even this I mean, like, even senior engineers above him
and the entire team agreed. We all had a consensus
and we went with the serverless approach that we built. And it's the same one that I'm talking about that
40,000,000 customers. So it was very like, this is something very common
at Amazon where people would have different opinions. But
the right way to deal with this is to have a healthy this quick discussion
And then if there's still disagreement, let's, like, go into more details
have a proper approach, and, like, hash it out.
Okay. Awesome. Thanks for sharing. And looking back,
what was the lesson learned for you from this situation?
Like, what would you do differently next time?
Honestly, how things went, like,
it was, like, something that,
like, because things went in a good direction. Right? So in terms of doing differently,
I'm not so sure because it was, like, a great result.
And this was exactly what we had wanted. No one was, like, sad or anything about
it. It's like these are technical decisions. Right? Right. But one learning
that we did take from it is we learned about new
architecture that like, the serverless architecture that the team had
hadn't too much experience with in the past. So we what we actually did was
this actually established a new standard in the entire organization
like in our team, where
everyone started adopting step functions and the serverless
architecture that I had built and that I had proposed. So it the
any learning from it, I think, for the entire team was, like, here, like, there's a good
like, document that he and I had built together.
And, like, we now saw the good good things and the bad things
about both those approaches. So if about learning, I think that would be the learning
point. In terms of doing diff things differently, I'm not so sure.
If, like, we we both actually enjoyed the conversation, to be honest. So
learning would be what what we had there.
Okay. Okay. Thanks for sharing. And
so let's talk about logistic of this
work. Like, this is a hybrid working model. I've heard that Amazon made it
fully on-site. Right? Yes. They did.
And this is because I've seen a lot of people from Amazon applying
to different jobs. They want to do the office.
But then we do have hybrid work
model, which I do appreciate.
The general policy is to be in the office at least 50 of our time over the course of a quarter. And the remainder, we have flexibility
to work from home.
Mhmm. And so given our location, I'm curious
how does the commute look like for you? I'm in Port Cook, Edelm, so it's
not be a problem at all. It's, like I feel like it's less than her
half an hour from the Cardium, like, headquarters. Four.
Is it a little bit more? Because of
the traffic in Maryhill and those, like, areas. Oh, that's
fair. I feel like you're familiar with the Pokhoe area then. I have to
pass it. Sorry. That's fair. Okay. Yeah. For me, personally,
I actually like, even at Amazon,
that that was not, like, like, an issue ever, to be honest with you.
I I actually have enjoyed, like, even traffic rides.
Because what personally I do because then I don't have to focus
much on the road. Of course, I'm still fully focused on the road.
But, like, with the, Tesla autopilot, all I am doing is
like, actually list either listening to podcasts or
literally just, like, talking to chat GPT about Oh my
my god. Planning my day. I'm sorry. I'm one of those people.
But no. But, like, it's
like, it's all fun and, like, dandy in terms of,
just, like, you know, I'm planning out my day sometimes and, like, what to do, like,
the oh, this I'll do this. So it's and but but the biggest thing that I resort
to is, like, just, like, you know, just sometimes listening to music and just calming like, you know,
like, not calming down now that I'm, like, hot headed or anything.
It's more so, like, just I'm I'm very much into mindfulness. So
like, mindfulness meditation. So, of course, while driving, I can't, like,
close my eyes or anything. But it's, like, sometimes appreciating what's in front of me
even if it is traffic.
And that's a nice way of doing that. I personally listen to
as well, but then I have full focus to the road because Oh, 100%.
Under a Tesla or a I have to pay attention to the road.
Okay. Thanks for sharing. And
in terms of a start date, how early can you
start a new role if you have an offer in hand?
I would say in terms of starting
like, I wouldn't, thank you. I wouldn't mind
like, having, like, maybe, like, a week or
two. Maybe, like, even that is kind of negotiable.
But, like, in terms like, flexibility wise, I'm quite flexible.
To the start date.
Okay. And, do you have any
upcoming vacation plans that you want us to be mindful of?
No. No no vacations right now. Yeah.
Okay. Sounds good. And let's talk about your salary expectation.
Can you please share your expected salary? Right.
Well, for that, one thing I'm thinking is I'm I'm definite
sorry.
Give me one second. Take a glass of water because sometimes they
Yep. When you talk a lot, then it's really hard.
Yeah. I know. That's why I did have, like, this with me. Yeah. Give me one moment.
Yeah. I'm not looking. Don't worry. Like, take your time.
For this, I would say I am definitely
sorry sorry about the the the hindrance in between, but
I'd say, like, I'm I'm looking for a package
a competitive package that does reflect my
like, more than five years of experience building, like, know, the
CICD systems and infrastructure at Amazon.
I see that the range
is, like, 90 to one forty on the job description with
like, that being the base plus RSP matching.
I'm hoping, like,
to learn more about the job itself and the things that would come with it.
And I think then I it's more so I'd be comfortable than
at later stage to learn, or to to to give
a definite number. But I'm wondering if
like, that like, I was hoping for a number from your end, but, like, I'm assuming it is the
the one that is on the job description itself. Is that correct?
Yeah. Like, we we did post the
range on the job posting, and then let's say I can give you more
context. Mhmm. Tell me how it works.
Cardium approach is very fair to compensation, and it's very data driven. Mhmm.
I want to be fully transparent. We are transparent in Southern discussions. You are coming from Amazon.
Amazon is one of the high paying companies Mhmm. In the market.
Our strategy is not that. Mhmm. We pay that
high. We don't pay low. We pay at average in the market. Mhmm. When it's
comes to total cash. And for us, total cash is base salary plus five RSV. Mhmm.
Then we do have
the minimum years of experience and the salary ranges there.
I would say with five years of experience, if it's fully relevant,
probably you are looking at a mark between
a 100 to a 110. Mhmm.
I'm comparing you with the data that we have, but
I can't be super accurate because, like, this is what I see, what we do,
We look at your years of experience, education,
Also, we take you to technical interview, and that's where we
assess your technical
I would say, skills as well, and that helps with the assessment Mhmm. Where the team
And we compare you against current employees Right. To make sure fairness is
there for them. So that's about base salary plus
5% retirement
I would say, what is that, savings
plan. We call it recently, like, savings plan.
And then what else we have is the stock
which is critical with a lot of
larger corporations, the stock option is a different thing. You're
Sorry. No worries.
So it's not a thing with a lot of, like,
I would say, big corporations. But then, like, we are
startup going for commercialization.
That is why I think
it's kinda like
it's important for a lot of candidates to know that we have stock options
everyone. Mhmm. Also, perks and benefits for us is
start from day one. There is no waiting period for that.
Because we are very transparent, we also expect candidates
give us at least a range. What we do, we
start a conversation early to avoid
really, like, tough conversations to us.
That offer. We we want people to know where they might land. Right? Right.
So knowing that, like, what do you think? Like, hearing out what I
said. Right.
Like, in I do have a quick follow-up question, and then maybe we can
proceed with that. Like, in terms of the negotiability,
of course, like, you've mentioned something about, in during the tech
part is when you guys really gauge
if the the range would increase or decrease
really depending on, like, how good or bad
the technical interview goes, of course. Right? Right.
It's not only that. Mhmm. Of course, with other things as well.
Yeah. It it can go less than 90 k for someone with
more than five years of experience. Mhmm.
How I can word it for you, some sometimes people, they have five years of
experience, but then their performance is, like,
three years of experience. It's still 90 in there. Right.
Then sometimes people, have five years of experience. Mhmm. But
the the depth of experience that they have is, like, a seven years experience person. Right?
Compare the performance against, like, current team Mhmm. And
also helps. Of course. So it really comes down to
those like, that technical assessment plus a combination of other
factors that we have here. Does that help? Yeah.
Of course, it does. Like, I mean yeah. Like, what I'm hearing is that, like,
things are very fair and transparent. Like, you know, we like, at
whatever the perceived understanding of the candidate is,
it'll be based on that and it'll be reflective of that.
And with the numbers I'm hearing, like, what I I would say, like, in
to you would be like, I'd be I I don't think it'd be a waste of time
continue forward, like, if we continued, like, the application process.
I'm sure, like, when I learn more about the company,
and when you guys would learn more about the company, I'm sure we would meet at a like,
it won't be, like, the numbers from both sides. I don't think it'd be so far off
from the numbers that you're saying that it would be ridiculous.
It's at least my understanding right now. Of course,
this is something that, like, like, if these are, like,
firm numbers, then it may be a different like, completely different story. But, like,
if if this is something like, yeah, of course, like, the you set a range.
I I'm what I'm let me put it short.
Concisely. It would be like, I'm happy to proceed
hearing what what you're saying. And, like, I think
would be a a good use of our time to to proceed forward.
With the numbers mentioned in the job description and the ones that you said
as well.
Okay. Yep. Thank you so much. I'm taking the notes.
And
we discussed this one. Discussing the company
itself, are we on time?
We are right now sitting at 11:15PM, but I am open for another hour.
So I'm it's okay from my end. It's completely up to you.
Yeah. Like, I would say sorry. I I lost the track of
time. I should have been better at this. Like, I did have
to leave in in five minutes. Mhmm. And let's
let's wrap it up. Knowing that you know about us helps
To give you high level information, we receive a
FDA approval. We are going for commercialization, and that's why Alex some teams are growing. A big portion goes to manufacturing, though.
But then our software test team and software team are all
growing because, like, they're covering a lot of
part of our business. Mhmm. And then it's kinda, like, take
And this role is under the DevOps department at Cardium. Mhmm. We do have a newer leader for DevOps department. We have a few very
experienced DevOps developer there, and then we are adding a
software tools engineer to that team to really be that
lesson between DevOps and tools. Mhmm. Because they're
very closely together. The technology they use
is Java, Kotlin, Python. Mhmm.
And
at Cardium, we are over 500 employees, medium sized company, not not a big corporation. Mhmm. So
people still matter. They they are not a number. They matter. Right? Of course.
And then I I'm sure that, like, you have heard about the
culture. Culture is very collaborative. It's innovative.
And people, like, enjoy coming to work and work
together. As for next step, I will
present your profile to the
team lead for DevOps team. Mhmm.
It's long weekend, so I I assume that
you will hear back from me mid to, I would say, late
next week. Before the week week, it would take
a while. I'm checking with you if the timing works for you.
Something that I think I made a mistake in sending you an email, there is no take home
test. Okay. I think I sent take home test. Okay. The
best steps would be this. Then
panel interview, and a final interview. There is
no executive interview too. Okay. That's the long version that I sent
to you, but I was trying to be quick, and that's the template we I didn't
delete that part. Mhmm. And I
sent it. I realized that I was still okay. Completely fine.
I called him no take home test. Absolutely. I I mean, of
of the time, I did have, like, a quick question and a quick clarify
on what we just talked about earlier as well. So I'm just wondering,
maybe we can get, like, the details about the next steps, in the email
itself, like, more details about it. Just to, like, respect your time, I did have, like,
an important clarification to make about what we discussed.
Sure. Yeah. So
terms of, like, like, my understanding about the five year thing that you're
mentioned, it was more so like, I'm assuming that was an example kind of thing.
And, even from my side, like, if you would look at my resume and everything,
it like, after UBC in 2018 is when I really
like, did the like, I joined the
four g consultancy, and then five years were only at Amazon.
So, like, it was more so, like, like, my my actual
experience has been, like, after UBC,
like, it's from, since 2018. So it's, like, more than five years. I just wanted to
kinda clarify that. And even in that those roles, it was with CICD.
Like, lot of build tooling and all those things involved.
And even during university, I like, like, the
the whole bachelor's engineering, I did the longer format.
Because I did co op and a lot of internships between. So there were four jobs
that weren't even mentioned, in my, like, actual, like, resume that I submitted.
As a kind of clarification, so my like, I think
the frame of reference that you had, I think, was
five years that I've mentioned was only at the Amazon. So I was kind of mentioning that.
But, yeah, like, just to make sure that there's, like, things are
completely in clarity. Yeah. About that.
The five years that I said, it's not about you. It was
experience. Oh, we're relevant. Relevant.
No. No. It's not the job thing. I Okay. Five year for the job posting. I think there is a misunderstanding there. I was not looking at
your resume. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Just as long as we are both on the same page. I think we are now.
Then in that case. Right. Perfect.
Yeah. And then the question was going to be about the next steps, but I'm assuming, like, I don't know if you have
time anymore. Sorry? Send me an email on that. Is that
right? Absolutely. A 100%.
Okay. Awesome, Abby. It was nice meeting with you today. Thanks again
for your time. Happy Thanksgiving if you celebrate or happy
fun if you don't celebrate.
I will be in touch with you next week. Okay? Thank you so much.
Was a genuine pleasure talking to you, Sarah. And, yeah, I look forward to the next
next steps.
Sure. Sure. A quick thing about the timeline. You asked you asked
question. I'm sorry. I didn't respond to that. The timeline is okay.
About, like, if you're getting back to me next week. I will let you know, of
course, like, in terms of I do have, like I'm
continuing like, I I currently am in process in the
or, like, with three companies. I'm in, like, early stages.
And with two companies, I'm in intermediate and with one company, it's actually in Burnaby itself, Electronic Arts. I'm in the last stage of interviews
with them. So but if anything comes out, like, in terms of offer or any
like, other things, I'll I'll keep you up to date.
I'm assuming that is what I think you were kind of referring to. Yeah.
I do appreciate your transparency and you keeping me
post posted on that. And then I'm also
going to get back to you next week. Perfect. Thank you so much.
You you take care. Have a good one. You too. Cheers. Bye.
