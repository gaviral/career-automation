## 1. Opening & Introduction

**Sara:** Good morning. How are you doing?

**Aviral:** I'm doing well. Thank you. How are you?

**Sara:** I'm doing very good. Thank you for asking. Aviral, thanks for making the time to speak with me. I work on talent team, partnering with different teams for their hirings. So you can see that this conversation is going to be very general conversation about your experience, background, motivations. I'll also share with you what we have here at Kardium. I think you have already talked to Michael, so you have some insight into what we do, but then that makes my life easier because I would high level information as well, and then we make sure we address any questions you might have. Definitely. Also, recording the transcription for notes taking and checking with you if you are fine with that.

**Aviral:** Absolutely. I am. And also, it wasn't just Michael even Alyssa. I talked to her quite a bit. I know she's on a medical leave right now. But yeah. She's a good friend of mine. We have known each other for a long time, so kind of connected with both Mike and Alyssa.

**Sara:** Yeah. Okay. That's nice. Yeah. Alyssa Simon or...

**Aviral:** Alyssa Simon. Okay. Okay.

**Sara:** Because I thought you were talking about Alicia. Okay. No. Alicia, I think she mentioned good things about you and how both of you also connected, I think, in some workshops. I'm sorry if I'm not remembering this thing correctly.

**Aviral:** I think so. Yeah. Like, we are connected, but I don't know. It's women's ERG. It's not a...

**Sara:** Oh, right. Right. Right. I'm also on women's ERG. Empowering women.

**Aviral:** Oh, nice. That's great.

**Sara:** Okay. So to like, and another heads up, I will be looking around. The reason why is that I have your resume on this screen. I have some questions there. And then the camera is up there, and the video is here so they can see that you are moving around. Like, my eyes go around, but then it doesn't mean that I'm not paying attention. Like, I'm just trying to tackle between different screens.

**Aviral:** Completely understandable. I do have my notes as well. Just in case there are some numbers and some, you know, things pop up. So kinda like disclaimer from my end as well if that's okay with you. But if not, I can even put them away if you like. Whatever your preference is.

**Sara:** That's okay. Like, thank you for giving me the heads up. That's like, this is a conversation. Like, this is not to grill you. This is just another conversation.

**Aviral:** Of course. Yeah. Okay. Thank you for the heads up, though.

## 2. Why Kardium & This Role

**Sara:** To start with, I'm curious. Other than, like, you know, some stuff about Kardium, what interests you in our company and this specific role?

**Aviral:** Absolutely. I'll try to dive straight right into this. And I'd say I think I remember having three biggest reasons that really intrigued me about this role. Having talked to Alyssa and knowing more and more about it, I think those three points would be:

1. **Meaningful Health Impact** - Obviously, is the meaningful health impact. I've always been interested in the medical field. At UBC where I did my computer software engineering, I chose for my final year capstone project, a neurotech HoloLens project where you could actually see in augmented reality using the HoloLens app. I don't know if you know about that device, but you can see, like, in front of the class, they would do demonstrations, and you could see two big brains floating around. And you could compare a healthy brain with a diseased brain. And even things like, you know, you say the word "love" - whatever the person is feeling and seeing, which part of their brain lights up, you would see that in real time. So these kind of things were like, it would just always fascinated me. And yeah, just that option of the health care focus is I see that Kardium doing such a great thing. It's literally lifesaving work. That takes it to a whole new level with creating the catheter for the ablation. I remember doing ablation in part of the heart that proves where the incorrect flutters are going. That's my very bird's eye view understanding of it.

2. **Perfect Technical Alignment** - The second point that I mentioned, CI/CD and building tools. I've done that at Amazon at a massive scale. If I were to talk about any of my projects, you would see that none of them like, even though I did a lot of software app development, at Amazon, we did not have separate DevOps teams. We were the owners of our own product, and before we actually built anything, we would always create the CI/CD pipeline first. We would create the tooling around it first to make sure we're delivering the right thing. It almost felt like, even though we were in beauty tech, but it felt like the mindfulness about how careful we are about things. It felt like we were in a health care field where people's life are, like, you know, in the balance. Of course, there's a little bit of just the culture itself of how things were. But I've felt that that's kinda how I felt.

3. **Culture and Team** - And third thing would be the culture and the team. From everything that I've learned about it, that would be one of the points.

Lastly, I'd say I'm ready to apply that training to the meaningful impact. Helping improve lives of millions. So I think this role exactly aligns with my experience and I'd say I felt like all the pieces came together - the CI/CD expertise, the passion for health impact, and the cultural values that I've learned about. I won't go too much into that culture value part because you probably already know about it. I can if you'd like me to about what I understood about it.

**Sara:** All good. Thank you so much. That's why I'm saying that they make my life easier when I'm a referral at Kardium because they share with you so much that I don't have to really go into culture and those details. Thank you for sharing.

## 3. Technical Experience & Transferability

**Sara:** So to get more specific with your role with Amazon, like, I'm curious. You worked on two different teams at Amazon. Software Development. And so can you share a little bit more details? Like, how do those experiences or projects that you focused on is transferable to this role? This role is under the DevOps team. But then it's interface between software test and tools. Right? So it's a mix of the two. So I want to understand from your perspective reading the job posting, what have you that you think is applicable to what we are looking for?

**Aviral:** 100%. I think one of the biggest things here that I saw in the job was about the build chains, about granular system monitoring. You are tracking bottlenecks. Having CI/CD, the tooling around it. I know I mentioned a tiny bit in my previous answer about how first thing that we thought about was always CI/CD pipeline. About operational readiness. 

So at Amazon, that's one thing I'm quite proud of. We weren't just "build like, here's our task that's given to us and I'm done with my task. It's someone else's problem now." No. Because we are the ones who are going to maintain it. We take it all the way from product requirements to all the way to maintaining it forever. So the first thing we do before we even do actual software development, we create an operational readiness review. This is a big document that we create where we talk about operations, operations, and operations, which is the tooling. How are we going to test things? When things break, how long will it take for me to debug that issue? Am I keeping good track of all the builds that we have? We are going to deploy so many softwares, so many versions of the same thing. Am I keeping a good documentation about it? Am I being that bridge between the software development, which myself am going to do, and the tooling and the people around me that who I'll be dealing with.

So at that level, what I'd say at Amazon Beauty Tech, I built a four stage CI/CD Python build chain, which had those granular system monitoring and bottleneck tracing. I can go more in details but I'd say, from an overall perspective, the impact of it was, I received organization wide accolades just for building the robust documentation and the operational readiness that we did in every step of the SDLC. 

I'll letâ€” oh, go ahead.

**Sara:** I'm sorry. Like, I thought you were done. Go ahead.

**Aviral:** Oh, yeah. I was just saying that in this project, I'd led a team of eight engineers where we built a serverless data pipeline. We had 40 plus million customers. We serve them across 15 different countries, and we had increased the frequency of the improvements by 50% because of the pipeline that I built, because of the tooling that we had built all around it. 

And one key thing I would say to wrap it up with the Prime Pantry team that I worked at before the beauty tech team: I actually championed AWS CDK adoption throughout the team. We didn't have proper standards of how we were creating our pipelines. I actually went ahead and created a whole standardized CI/CD process so that everyone else in the team could follow. Again, it was the same thing. It was you can see how even though there was dev app development, but the part about CI/CD tooling and everything kept coming in along with documentation, and I kind of created the new standards even in software development because of my passion in CI/CD coming back in.

One small example I'd give is, even outside work, this passion for CI/CD isn't just at work. Even outside that, how I've approached more than 30 personal projects, all of them have CI/CD in them. Right now, if I could go, like, even my website, it's not just I created something and it just shows up there. It has testing even though people usually don't do that. One project that I have which has more than 8,000 downloads on a very popular website. Even that has build numbers and software versioning numbers. So that right there made me think, "Hey. Why not? Actually, this is my key passion that I keep coming back to. Why don't I actually apply for this build engineer senior build engineer position and just thrive there." Combine it with my passion for health care and seeing all those great cultural values that the company brings.

**Sara:** Okay. That's awesome. Thanks for sharing.

## 4. Java & Language Experience

**Sara:** And then I can see a lot of Python here. What about working with Java?

**Aviral:** It isâ€” so one thing I would say is my go-to definitely is Python. But I have dealt with Java, even Kotlin. At Prime Pantry, I remember one of my first tasks at Prime Pantry was to work with Kotlin. And I created the API and it received 100% test coverage that no one had received before. So, again, the this thing came in. But even though I wouldn't say I'm a perfect expert at Kotlin slash Java. They're very similar. But I've dealt with seven different languages at Amazon, and four of them I'd never dealt with them before in the past. But that never hindered me from ever delivering things quickly and learning those things up because we've always beenâ€” at least me personally, I've always been agnostic of what language I'm using. The guiding principles are always the same. Of course, this doesn't work when you are in a C++ role that's very low level. But I feel like at build engineering level, this is something that comes in very handy where having sufficient knowledge about how languages work in general should be very easy for me to pick it up, Java, Kotlin.

**Sara:** Yeah. Agree. When you know object oriented language, then it should be pretty easy transition. The reason I ask you is that I know our team is using Python. However, our software test team and almost all the teams, they use Java mainly and then Python. So Java would be the main language, though I don't know once they develop something that they are like, "No. Like, we don't want to use Java. Let's do Python."

---

## 5. Collaboration & Cross-functional Work

**Sara:** And then in terms of the interactions that you had within those team projects, how was the workflow for you? Like, where did you get your input? Like, which teams or, let's say, job titles did you work with? And then where the result of your work was going?

**Aviral:** Yeah. 100%. In terms of interaction and the kind of people I've worked with, I've had a wide variety of people that I've had a chance to work with. Like, from school projects to internships to Amazon. I've had a chance to deal with neuroscientists. I've had a chance to deal with doctors, Japanese language professors, product managers, software development managers, a lot of dealing with business intelligence because we're working backward from what not only what are we creating, but why are we and what impact are we going to have. I've had a chance to deal with even technical artists and creative writers.

It's one thing I've always seen is it's never really an issue for me to being able to understand, to be in someone else's shoes and understand that they're not technical people. They understand things, what are happening at the big picture, and what they want things to be done. So my process usually is let's focus on not how the engineer is going to fix this issue or create this new feature. It's always about what are we working on? Is there a pain point? Let's work backward from there. Or what new feature or what new product that you want to create, let's work backward from there. What does that really do? And then we talk aboutâ€” I usually take the abstraction of the technical things and be able to communicate very efficiently with people from a variety of different fields.

In terms of the results that you asked, like, how does that drive the results? I've had in all the projects that I've dealt with, simple personal projects, I remember mentioning in a simple open source project, I had more than actually 8,000 downloads on an open source personal project that I created. That's something I don't think it's too big, but at the same time worth mentioning. But taking it to the bigger picture level, the data pipelines that I've worked with where I dealt with even makeup artists and dealt with learning so much about bronzer and foundation. Like, I know too many things about makeup now because I dealt with those people. And now those pipelines are serving more than 40,000,000 customers worldwide in 15 countries. And there are transactions happening on those things. There are billion interactions with the products that I've built. I can go even more detailed if you like but I think this kinda gives you an overall gist of where I'm coming from.

**Sara:** Yeah. Thank you so much.

## 6. Career Goals

**Sara:** And then, Aviral, what is your career goal at this point? Where do you see yourself in the next two and five years? What do you want to achieve?

**Aviral:** Absolutely. So this answer, I think I can give you by seeing how my journey has been very briefly. At UBC, I learned about computer software foundational principles. I applied those in health care and in other areas as well. Then after that, I went to T4G consultancy where I learned about how to quickly transition from talking to very different kind of people. I've dealt with very differentâ€” there was a tire company, and then there was this medical company, and then even someone who sells the baseboards and houses. Creating chatbots. So that was an experience where I applied what I learned at UBC, applied that in different areas.

At Amazon, I learned how to now apply those same things at a scale, how to take that to millions, not millions, billions of customers. With that, I feel like this almost feels like a training phase. And now to me, I'm like, where can I apply those things and go more and more towards making a big impact? And that right there, I think, would help me answer the two year and five year question is being at Kardium feels like this is one place I can apply all my learning into making a bigger impact in health care and to people.

Two years, I'm seeing myself being the software build engineer who is now doing more career growth inside Kardium itself and taking over more responsibility, if possible. If possible being, I'm not sure exactly how the career chain and the growth works at Kardium, but definitely taking on more roles, having more bigger projects, and taking on more developers for doing mentorship for them. And I feel like it's something very similar for five year term as well because that right there would be just continuing to grow in the field, in the company, and making that impact. Of course, that depends also on how Kardium sees me as the person doing that work. And for me, if, like, how things align. Of course, with my values, I see that right now with Kardium, all the things that I've heard. I'm sure after experiencing that idea would only reinforce and become even stronger.

**Sara:** Right. Right. Okay. Thank you for sharing. We are a growing company for sure. Like, we are at a stage that there are a lot of opportunities for growth. Though, nothing is guaranteed in life, there are a lot of avenues that people they can grow. Also, we have a huge co-op program where people, they can develop on their leadership skills as well, like, taking full responsibility for a co-op. I found that way to be a very good way to really be a leader quicker. Also, we have a lot of internal projects that people, they can take ownership on and then develop their project management skills. I don't know what it looks like in the next two, three years. But this is what I know and what I've experienced myself first on that at Kardium.

## 7. Behavioral Question - Disagreement with Coworker

**Sara:** Understanding your working side, my next question is about that. Can you share an experience of a time when you had a difference of opinion with a coworker. What was the situation, and how did you handle that?

**Aviral:** Absolutely. This actually reminds me of one such experience in the virtual try-on project, one of the biggest projects that I worked at Amazon Beauty Tech. And to give you a tiny bit of context, it was like, if you go on Amazon app right now, click on a lipstick and click a VTO button, you can actually try that lipstick and see what that would look like in augmented reality. You would see yourself and that lipstick, a 3D asset created, right on your lips being tracked. Now the project that we worked on was extracting the visual properties. What is the finish type? Like, is it matte finish? Is it shiny? The RGB colors. And what are the particles? If there are any, what is their size?

Given having given you the context of what we worked on, there was a disagreement with a colleague of mine, he was actually a senior engineer. And we had a disagreement about the design that we were proposing. There were two kinds of design for this. One was EC2â€” I'm on a very high level. I'll just tell you that there was server architecture and then a serverless architecture. And he said that we should go for a server whereas I said serverless. And we had a disagreement about this. And it was a very good healthy discussion, but he continued to say that he is correct. And I said myâ€” and that was... You were saying that you were correct. So it's more so, and we didn't obviously say that. It was more so about "I think that this is the right approach." And he had believed in his approach.

So theâ€” and it was a very quick discussion. After that, how I resolved that was I actually createdâ€” we were to create a system wide diagrams, create a whole system design, and propose the solution. So what I did in this situation was we set up a meeting with him and me where I showed him why I think this designâ€” what are the advantages and even disadvantages of my approach and showed the advantages and disadvantages of his approach. And we actually discussed more details about why the cost of this approach is higher. Of the approach that he went for. But it was like, there were parts about it that were good too. But it wasn't that important. It would serve things very fast. But we did not need things to be real time. We needed things to beâ€” it can take one day, and that's completely fine because we had five days of waiting and if it take one day instead of one hour, that's completely fine.

And he actually agreed with my approach. And once I had his traction and he agreed withâ€” he genuinely saw that this was a much better approach. We even had a team wide discussion after that, and everyoneâ€” even senior engineers above him and the entire team agreed. We all had a consensus and we went with the serverless approach that we built. And it's the same one that I'm talking about that served 40,000,000 customers. So it was veryâ€” this is something very common at Amazon where people would have different opinions. But the right way to deal with this is to have a healthy quick discussion. And then if there's still disagreement, let's go into more details, have a proper approach, and hash it out.

**Sara:** Okay. Awesome. Thanks for sharing. And looking back, what was the lesson learned for you from this situation? Like, what would you do differently next time?

**Aviral:** Honestly, how things went, it was something thatâ€” because things went in a good direction. So in terms of doing differently, I'm not so sure because it was a great result. And this was exactly what we had wanted. No one was sad or anything about it. These are technical decisions. But one learning that we did take from it is we learned about new architecture thatâ€” the serverless architecture that the team hadn't had too much experience with in the past. So what we actually did was this actually established a new standard in the entire organization, in our team, where everyone started adopting step functions and the serverless architecture that I had built and that I had proposed. So any learning from it, I think, for the entire team was, here, there's a good document that he and I had built together. And we now saw the good things and the bad things about both those approaches. So if about learning, I think that would be the learning point. In terms of doing things differently, I'm not so sure. We both actually enjoyed the conversation, to be honest. So learning would be what we had there.

**Sara:** Okay. Okay. Thanks for sharing.

## 8. Logistics

### Commute & Hybrid Work

**Sara:** And so let's talk about logistic of this work. Like, this is a hybrid working model. I've heard that Amazon made it fully on-site. Right?

**Aviral:** Yes. They did.

**Sara:** And this is because I've seen a lot of people from Amazon applying to different jobs. They want to do remote. But then we do have hybrid work model, which I do appreciate. The general policy is to be in the office at least 50% of our time over the course of a quarter. And the remainder, we have flexibility to work from home. And so given our location, I'm curious how does the commute look like for you?

**Aviral:** I'm in Port Coquitlam, so it's not going to be a problem at all. It's like I feel like it's less than half an hour from the Kardium headquarters.

**Sara:** Is it a little bit more? Because of the traffic in Maryhill and those areas.

**Aviral:** Oh, that's fair. I feel like you're familiar with the Port Coquitlam area then.

**Sara:** I have to pass it.

**Aviral:** Sorry. That's fair. Okay. Yeah. For me, personally, I actually even at Amazon, that was not an issue ever, to be honest with you. I actually have enjoyed even traffic rides. Because what personally I doâ€” because then I don't have to focus much on the road. Of course, I'm still fully focused on the road. But with the Tesla autopilot, all I am doing is actually either listening to podcasts or literally just talking to ChatGPT about planning my day. I'm sorry. I'm one of those people. But no, it's all fun and dandy in terms of just, you know, I'm planning out my day sometimes and what to do. So it'sâ€” but the biggest thing that I resort to is just sometimes listening to music and justâ€” not calming down like I'm hot headed or anything. It's more so, just I'm very much into mindfulness. Like, mindfulness meditation. So, of course, while driving, I can't close my eyes or anything. But it's sometimes appreciating what's in front of me even if it is traffic.

**Sara:** And that's a nice way of doing that. I personally listen to podcasts as well, but then I have full focus to the road because I don't have a Tesla.

**Aviral:** Oh, 100%. I have to pay attention to the road.

### Start Date

**Sara:** Okay. Thanks for sharing. And in terms of a start date, how early can you start a new role if you have an offer in hand?

**Aviral:** I would say in terms of starting, I wouldn't mind having maybe a week or two. Maybe even that is kind of negotiable. But in terms of flexibility wise, I'm quite flexible to the start date.

**Sara:** Okay.

### Vacation Plans

**Sara:** And do you have any upcoming vacation plans that you want us to be mindful of?

**Aviral:** No. No no vacations right now. Yeah.

**Sara:** Okay. Sounds good.

## 9. Salary Discussion

**Sara:** And let's talk about your salary expectation. Can you please share your expected salary?

**Aviral:** Right. Well, for that, one thing I'm thinking is I'mâ€” sorry. Give me one second. Take a glass of water because sometimes when you talk a lot, then it's really hard.

**Sara:** Yeah. I know. That's why I did have this with me. Yeah. Give me one moment. Yeah. I'm not looking. Don't worry. Take your time.

**Aviral:** For this, I would say I am definitelyâ€” sorry about the hindrance in between, but I'd say I'm looking for a competitive package that does reflect my more than five years of experience building the CI/CD systems and infrastructure at Amazon. I see that the range is 90 to 140 on the job description with that being the base plus RSP matching. I'm hoping to learn more about the job itself and the things that would come with it. And I think then I'd be comfortable at a later stage to learn, or to give a definite number. But I'm wondering ifâ€” I was hoping for a number from your end, but I'm assuming it is the one that is on the job description itself. Is that correct?

**Sara:** Yeah. We did post the range on the job posting, and then let's say I can give you more context. Tell me how it works. Kardium's approach is very fair to compensation, and it's very data driven. I want to be fully transparent. We are transparent in salary discussions. You are coming from Amazon. Amazon is one of the high paying companies in the market. Our strategy is not that. We pay that high. We don't pay low. We pay at average in the market when it comes to total cash. And for us, total cash is base salary plus 5% RSP [Retirement Savings Plan].

Then we do have the minimum years of experience and the salary ranges there. I would say with five years of experience, if it's fully relevant, probably you are looking at a mark between 100 to 110. I'm comparing you with the data that we have, but I can't be super accurate because this is what I see, what we do. We look at your years of experience, education. Also, we take you to technical interview, and that's where we assess your technical, I would say, skills as well, and that helps with the assessment. And we compare you against current employees to make sure fairness is there for them. So that's about base salary plus 5% retirement savings plan. We call it recently, savings plan.

And then what else we have is the stock option, which is critical. With a lot of larger corporations, the stock option is a different thing. You'reâ€”

**Aviral:** Sorry. No worries.

**Sara:** So it's not a thing with a lot of, I would say, big corporations. But then, we are a startup going for commercialization. That is why I think it's kinda important for a lot of candidates to know that we have stock options for everyone. Also, perks and benefits for us start from day one. There is no waiting period for that. Because we are very transparent, we also expect candidates to give us at least a range. What we do, we start a conversation early to avoid really tough conversations at the offer stage. We want people to know where they might land. So knowing that, what do you think? Like, hearing out what I said.

**Aviral:** I do have a quick follow-up question, and then maybe we can proceed with that. In terms of the negotiability, of course, you've mentioned something about, during the tech part is when you guys really gauge if the range would increase or decrease really depending on how good or bad the technical interview goes, of course. Right?

**Sara:** It's not only that. Of course, with other things as well. It can go less than 90k for someone with more than five years of experience. How I can word it for you, sometimes people, they have five years of experience, but then their performance is like three years of experience. It's still 90 minimum there. Then sometimes people have five years of experience, but the depth of experience that they have is like a seven years experience person. We compare the performance against current team and that also helps. So it really comes down to thoseâ€” that technical assessment plus a combination of other factors that we have here. Does that help?

**Aviral:** Yeah. Of course, it does. Like, I mean yeah. What I'm hearing is that things are very fair and transparent. At whatever the perceived understanding of the candidate is, it'll be based on that and it'll be reflective of that. And with the numbers I'm hearing, what I would say to you would be like, I don't think it'd be a waste of time to continue forward, if we continued the application process. I'm sure when I learn more about the company, and when you guys would learn more about me, I'm sure we would meet at aâ€” it won't be, the numbers from both sides. I don't think it'd be so far off from the numbers that you're saying that it would be ridiculous. It's at least my understanding right now. Of course, this is something that if these are firm numbers, then it may be a different, completely different story. But if this is something like, yeah, of course, you set a range. 

Let me put it concisely. It would be: I'm happy to proceed hearing what you're saying. And I think it would be a good use of our time to proceed forward with the numbers mentioned in the job description and the ones that you said as well.

**Sara:** Okay. Yep. Thank you so much. I'm taking the notes.

## 10. Company Overview & Next Steps

**Sara:** And we discussed this one. Discussing the company itself, are we on time?

**Aviral:** We are right now sitting at 11:15 AM, but I am open for another hour. So I'mâ€” it's okay from my end. It's completely up to you.

**Sara:** Yeah. I would say sorry. I lost the track of time. I should have been better at this. I did have to leave in in five minutes. And let's wrap it up. Knowing that you know about us helps. To give you high level information, we received FDA approval. We are going for commercialization, and that's why some teams are growing. A big portion goes to manufacturing, though. But then our software test team and software team are all growing because they're covering a lot of part of our business. And then it's kinda take on that.

And this role is under the DevOps department at Kardium. We do have a newer leader for DevOps department. We have a few very experienced DevOps developer there, and then we are adding a software tools engineer to that team to really be that liaison between DevOps and tools. Because they're very closely together. The technology they use is Java, Kotlin, Python.

And at Kardium, we are over 500 employees, medium sized company, not a big corporation. So people still matter. They are not a number. They matter. And then I'm sure that you have heard about the culture. Culture is very collaborative. It's innovative. And people enjoy coming to work and work together. 

As for next step, I will present your profile to the team lead for DevOps team. It's long weekend, so I assume that you will hear back from me mid to, I would say, late next week. It would take a while. I'm checking with you if the timing works for you. Something that I think I made a mistake in sending you an email, there is no take home test. I think I sent take home test. The next steps would be this HR screen, then panel interview, and a final interview. There is no executive interview too. That's the long version that I sent to you, but I was trying to be quick, and that's the template weâ€” I didn't delete that part. And I sent it. I realized that.

**Aviral:** Completely fine. I called him. No take home test. Absolutely. I mean, of the time, I did have a quick question and a quick clarification on what we just talked about earlier as well. So I'm just wondering, maybe we can get the details about the next steps in the email itself. Just to respect your time, I did have an important clarification to make about what we discussed.

**Sara:** Sure. Yeah.

**Aviral:** In terms of my understanding about the five year thing that you mentioned, it was more so like, I'm assuming that was an example kind of thing. And even from my side, if you would look at my resume and everything, after UBC in 2018 is when I really joined the T4G consultancy, and then five years were only at Amazon. So it was more so, my actual experience has been after UBC, since 2018. So it's more than five years. I just wanted to kinda clarify that. And even in those roles, it was with CI/CD. Lot of build tooling and all those things involved. And even during university, the whole bachelor's engineering, I did the longer format. Because I did co-op and a lot of internships between. So there were four jobs that weren't even mentioned in my actual resume that I submitted. As a kind of clarification, so myâ€” I think the frame of reference that you had, I think, was five years that I've mentioned was only at the Amazon. So I was kind of mentioning that. But, yeah, just to make sure that things are completely in clarity about that.

**Sara:** The five years that I said, it's not about you. It was just an example. It's not the job thing. Five year for the job posting. I think there is a misunderstanding there. I was not looking at your resume.

**Aviral:** Okay. Okay. Perfect. Just as long as we are both on the same page. I think we are now. Then in that case. Perfect.

**Sara:** Yeah. And then the question was going to be about the next steps, but I'm assuming I don't know if you have time anymore.

**Aviral:** Send me an email on that. Is that right?

**Sara:** Absolutely. 100%.

## 11. Closing

**Sara:** Okay. Awesome, Aviral. It was nice meeting with you today. Thanks again for your time. Happy Thanksgiving if you celebrate or happy long weekend if you don't celebrate. I will be in touch with you next week. Okay?

**Aviral:** Thank you so much. It was a genuine pleasure talking to you, Sara. And, yeah, I look forward to the next steps.

**Sara:** Sure. Sure. A quick thing about the timeline. You asked a question. I'm sorry. I didn't respond to that. The timeline is okay. About if you're getting back to me next week.

**Aviral:** I will let you know, of course. In terms ofâ€” I do haveâ€” I currently am in process with three companies. I'm in early stages. And with two companies, I'm in intermediate stages. And with one company, it's actually in Burnaby itself, Electronic Arts. I'm in the last stage of interviews with them. So but if anything comes out, in terms of offer or any other things, I'll keep you up to date. I'm assuming that is what I think you were kind of referring to.

**Sara:** Yeah. I do appreciate your transparency and you keeping me posted on that. And then I'm also going to get back to you next week.

**Aviral:** Perfect. Thank you so much. You take care. Have a good one.
